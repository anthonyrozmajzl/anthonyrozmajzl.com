Like \n{{author.name}}, for example, outputs the name of the current author.\n\nThe best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at \nthe\nsource code for Casper [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper], which is heavily\ncommented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.\n\n * default.hbs  is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this\n   file unless specifically told to use a different template.\n * post.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing a post.\n * index.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.\n * and so on\n\nWe've got full and extensive theme documentation\n[http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about]  which outlines every template file,\ncontext and helper that you can use.\n\nIf you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a #themes  channel in our public Slack community\n[https://slack.ghost.org]  which we always recommend joining!","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/design.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2018-02-25T23:25:36.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-02-26T02:49:57.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-02-25T23:25:36.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c47","uuid":"c8687e8f-4650-4c3d-8785-7352f35ad62c","title":"Advanced Markdown tips","slug":"advanced-markdown","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Ghost editor\\n\\nIf you've gotten pretty comfortable with [all the basics](/the-editor/) of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!\\n\\nAs with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.\\n\\n\\n## Special formatting\\n\\nAs well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:\\n\\n+ ~~strike through~~\\n+ ==highlight==\\n+ \\\\*escaped characters\\\\*\\n\\n\\n## Writing code blocks\\n\\nThere are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block.

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging\nposts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of\nrelated content.\n\nBasic tagging\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between\ncategories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with News  and\nother posts with Cycling, which would create two distinct categories of content\nlisted on /tag/news/  and /tag/cycling/, respectively.\n\nIf you tag a post with both News  and  Cycling  - then it appears in both\nsections.\n\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you\nhave. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own\ncover images and meta data.\n\nThe primary tag\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The\nfirst tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will\nonly display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can\nadd the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add\na bunch of related tags which are less important.\n\nNews, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports\n\nIn this example, News  is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme,\nbut the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their\nrespective archives.\n\nPrivate tags\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't\nnecessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In\nGhost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\nNews, Cycling, #video\n\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and \nCycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with\n #video.\n\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them\nspecial formatting:\n\n{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=\"#video\"}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n\n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation [https://themes.ghost.org/].","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2018-02-25T23:25:37.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-02-26T02:49:04.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-02-25T23:25:40.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4b","uuid":"37f7d756-d34d-4c8d-a315-5d9f58e2b3ed","title":"Using the Ghost editor","slug":"the-editor","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Ghost uses a language called **Markdown** to format text.\\n\\nWhen you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document.

DataCamp's platform is super easy to use and does an excellent job of testing your skills with practical examples. \\n\\nUnlike my high school coding class, DataCamp's interactive platform nudges you in the right direction when your code needs to be tweaked. I vividly remember the frustration involved with having to walk up to my teacher time and time again to ask for help whenever I was stuck. I was just hoping that my teacher wasn't also backed up with other students who were stuck in the same boat as me. The point is, anybody who wants to learn Python, R, or SQL should definitely give DataCamp a try.\\n\\nOne of my favorite chapters from DataCamp's *Data Scientist with Python* career track was their introduction to `for` loops. After starting with the fundamentals, I eventually learned how to construct a `for` loop that builds a distribution for flipping a coin. I know that this is old hat for more experienced coders, but for me it was a gratifying challenge.\\n\\nBelow is the Python code and the steps I used to produce my coin flip distribution:\\n\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport random\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nheads = 0\\nrounds = 10\\ntosses = 100\\n\\nheads_per_round = []\\n\\nfor round in range (rounds):\\n    for flips in range(tosses):\\n        coin = np.random.randint(1,3)\\n        if coin == 1:\\n            heads+=1\\n    heads_per_round.append(heads)\\n    heads = 0\\n    \\nplt.hist(heads_per_round, bins =10, color=\\\"red\\\", alpha=.5)\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n![Coin-Toss-graph-1](/content/images/2018/08/Coin-Toss-graph-1.png)\\n\\nHmmmm.  That doesn't look that useful.  We'll fix that later.  For now, let's break down the code.\\n\\n## Code Walk-Through\\n\\n### Collect Number of Heads per Round\\nI created the empty list `heads_per_round` to track the number of heads that were recorded for each of the rounds of coin flips. \\n\\n### Need a Counter\\nThe `heads` variable is initialized to 0 because it represents the starting number of heads that have shown up. It's reset to 0 at the end of each round. Obviously, you could also count the number of tails that appear. This is just a matter of changing the variable definitions.\\n\\n### The Rounds\\nThe outer `for` loop represents the number of *rounds* of coin tosses. Number of rounds is captured in the `rounds` variable. \\n\\n### The Tosses\\nThe inner loop represents the number of coin flips per round. The number of tosses is set in the `tosses` variable. For every round of 100 tosses, we might get something like 40 or 53 or 65 heads. That number of heads is appended to the list `heads_per_round`. \\n\\n### The Coin\\nThe variable `coin` captures the result of a virtual coin toss. Defining `coin` as 'np.random.randint(1,3)' produce either a 1 or a 2. If our virtual coin = 1, then we add 1 to the variable 'heads'.  Thus, our list `heads_per_round` might look like the following: `[44, 54, 48, 60, 55, 41, 48, 58, ... , 59, 65]`.\\n\\n### Seeing the Results\\nThe final step is to plot the list `heads_per_round`. A histogram will allow you to visualize your data as a distribution.\\n\\nThat histogram produced above looks a little sparse and not quite what we want. This is because our sample size of 10 rounds of coin tosses is pretty small. The more rounds we run, the more data points we can collect and the more closely the histogram will reflect a normal distribution. \\n\\nWhat follows are two histograms: the first illustrates 100 rounds of 1,000 coin tosses and the second illustrates 1,000 rounds of coin 10,000 tosses. What we should see are two histograms more closely resembling a normal distribution.\\n\\n### 100 Rounds of 1,000 Tosses\\n```python\\n...\\nrounds = 100\\ntosses = 1000\\n...\\n```\\n![Coin-Toss-graph-2](/content/images/2018/08/Coin-Toss-graph-2.png)\\n\\n### 1,000 Rounds of 10,000 Tosses\\n\\n![Coin-Toss-graph-3](/content/images/2018/08/Coin-Toss-graph-3.png)\\n\\nI could continue to increase `rounds` and `tosses` to achieve an almost perfectly-normal distribution. \\n\\nNow, good programmers are constantly looking for ways to improve their code, including simplifying it.  Here is a nicely-refactored version of code that produces the results of 1,000 rounds of 10,000 coin tosses:\\n\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\nheads_per_round = []\\nrounds = 1000\\ntosses = 10000\\nfor round in range(rounds):\\n    heads_per_round.append((np.random.randint(0,2,tosses)>0).sum())\\n\\nplt.hist(heads_per_round, bins = 20)\\n```\\n\\nAs before, we create the empty list to track the number of heads that showed up for each round of tosses. The loop cycles through 1,000 rounds, each of which will have 10,000 tosses. \\n\\nThe magic occurs in the line of code just beneath the `for` loop. The code `np.random.randint(0,2,tosses)>0).sum()` randomly generates an array of 0's and 1's, filters out all the 0's (leaving only 1's remaining), and sums all elements, giving the total number of \\\"heads\\\" for that round. (Gotta love NumPy!).\\n\\nSo what does this look like?\\n\\n![Coin-Toss-Simple](/content/images/2018/08/Coin-Toss-Simple.png)\\n\\nAgain, it appears that 1,000 rounds appears to produce another distribution that closely resembles the normal distribution.\\n\\n# Wrap Up\\n\\nA little over a month ago, producing this kind of distribution would have been challenging for me. Looking back on how far I have come, this simple coin toss distribution boosted my confidence as a coder. I plan to share more examples of what I have learned with Python and am looking forward to broadening my knowledge with Data Camp's *Data Scientist with R* career track.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Plugging through the Python courses at DataCamp has been (for the most part) quite a bit of fun.

Anyone who has gone through the process of learning a new\ncoding language will understand why I included the parentheses. My last exposure\nto any sort of coding was a C++ class in high school, and I remember coming out\nof that class swearing to drop the whole coding thing forever. I hated how\nnitpicky the coding syntax was; and even if I had the syntax correct, there was\nno guarantee that my code would produce what I wanted . . . and it rarely did. I\njust couldn't believe that anybody would want to do this for a living.\n\nSix years later and I am giving the whole coding thing another shot, this time\nwith the much more engaging and interactive DataCamp. It hasn't been a walk in\nthe park by any means, but I am definitely learning a lot more than I did in my\ntextbook-style high school class. DataCamp's platform is super easy to use and\ndoes an excellent job of testing your skills with practical examples.\n\nUnlike my high school coding class, DataCamp's interactive platform nudges you\nin the right direction when your code needs to be tweaked. I vividly remember\nthe frustration involved with having to walk up to my teacher time and time\nagain to ask for help whenever I was stuck. I was just hoping that my teacher\nwasn't also backed up with other students who were stuck in the same boat as me.\nThe point is, anybody who wants to learn Python, R, or SQL should definitely\ngive DataCamp a try.\n\nOne of my favorite chapters from DataCamp's Data Scientist with Python  career\ntrack was their introduction to for  loops. After starting with the\nfundamentals, I eventually learned how to construct a for  loop that builds a\ndistribution for flipping a coin. I know that this is old hat for more\nexperienced coders, but for me it was a gratifying challenge.\n\nBelow is the Python code and the steps I used to produce my coin flip\ndistribution:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\nheads = 0\nrounds = 10\ntosses = 100\n\nheads_per_round = []\n\nfor round in range (rounds):\n    for flips in range(tosses):\n        coin = np.random.randint(1,3)\n        if coin == 1:\n            heads+=1\n    heads_per_round.append(heads)\n    heads = 0\n    \nplt.hist(heads_per_round, bins =10, color=\"red\", alpha=.5)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nHmmmm. That doesn't look that useful. We'll fix that later. For now, let's break\ndown the code.\n\nCode Walk-Through\nCollect Number of Heads per Round\nI created the empty list heads_per_round  to track the number of heads that were\nrecorded for each of the rounds of coin flips.\n\nNeed a Counter\nThe heads  variable is initialized to 0 because it represents the starting\nnumber of heads that have shown up. It's reset to 0 at the end of each round.\nObviously, you could also count the number of tails that appear. This is just a\nmatter of changing the variable definitions.\n\nThe Rounds\nThe outer for  loop represents the number of rounds  of coin tosses. Number of\nrounds is captured in the rounds  variable.\n\nThe Tosses\nThe inner loop represents the number of coin flips per round. The number of\ntosses is set in the tosses  variable. For every round of 100 tosses, we might\nget something like 40 or 53 or 65 heads. That number of heads is appended to the\nlist heads_per_round.\n\nThe Coin\nThe variable coin  captures the result of a virtual coin toss. Defining coin  as\n'np.random.randint(1,3)' produce either a 1 or a 2. If our virtual coin = 1,\nthen we add 1 to the variable 'heads'. Thus, our list heads_per_round  might\nlook like the following: [44, 54, 48, 60, 55, 41, 48, 58, ... , 59, 65].\n\nSeeing the Results\nThe final step is to plot the list heads_per_round. A histogram will allow you\nto visualize your data as a distribution.\n\nThat histogram produced above looks a little sparse and not quite what we want.\nThis is because our sample size of 10 rounds of coin tosses is pretty small. The\nmore rounds we run, the more data points we can collect and the more closely the\nhistogram will reflect a normal distribution.\n\nWhat follows are two histograms: the first illustrates 100 rounds of 1,000 coin\ntosses and the second illustrates 1,000 rounds of coin 10,000 tosses. What we\nshould see are two histograms more closely resembling a normal distribution.\n\n100 Rounds of 1,000 Tosses\n...\nrounds = 100\ntosses = 1000\n...\n\n\n\n\n1,000 Rounds of 10,000 Tosses\n\n\nI could continue to increase rounds  and tosses  to achieve an almost\nperfectly-normal distribution.\n\nNow, good programmers are constantly looking for ways to improve their code,\nincluding simplifying it. Here is a nicely-refactored version of code that\nproduces the results of 1,000 rounds of 10,000 coin tosses:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nheads_per_round = []\nrounds = 1000\ntosses = 10000\nfor round in range(rounds):\n    heads_per_round.append((np.random.randint(0,2,tosses)>0).sum())\n\nplt.hist(heads_per_round, bins = 20)\n\n\nAs before, we create the empty list to track the number of heads that showed up\nfor each round of tosses. The loop cycles through 1,000 rounds, each of which\nwill have 10,000 tosses.\n\nThe magic occurs in the line of code just beneath the for  loop. The code \nnp.random.randint(0,2,tosses)>0).sum()  randomly generates an array of 0's and\n1's, filters out all the 0's (leaving only 1's remaining), and sums all\nelements, giving the total number of \"heads\" for that round. (Gotta love\nNumPy!).\n\nSo what does this look like?\n\n\n\nAgain, it appears that 1,000 rounds appears to produce another distribution that\nclosely resembles the normal distribution.\n\nWrap Up\nA little over a month ago, producing this kind of distribution would have been\nchallenging for me. Looking back on how far I have come, this simple coin toss\ndistribution boosted my confidence as a coder.

When prices increase, we typically look with scorn on the company raising the prices, especially if the price change seems arbitrary. It's easy to be understanding when grocery stores, for example, need to increase their prices if the cost of stocking their shelves rises. However, we'd be a little less understanding if we found them raising prices for no good reason. \\n\\nStrangely, the typical negativity towards price increases doesn't seem to hold when the government is the one raising the prices, specifically when it inflates labor prices through minimum wage laws.\\n\\n# Supply and demand in the labor market\\nBasic economics tells us that when the price of any good is arbitrarily raised above its market value, buyers will demand less of the good while sellers will want to supply more of it. Labor, just like any other economic good, falls under these same rules. When the government raises the price of labor above the market rate, fewer employers (buyers of labor) will be willing to hire, while more workers (sellers of labor) will be willing to work. As a result, a surplus of labor (i.e., unemployment) ensues.\\n\\nWorkers see the minimum wage as a good thing because their paychecks will increase. Employers, on the other hand, view the wage increases as a bad thing because they raise operating costs. This tug of war between employer and worker creates an imbalance in the marketplace where employers become less willing to hire, but individuals become more willing to work. The only way to correct this imbalance is for the government to allow the price of labor to return to its market level by removing minimum wage controls. \\n\\n# Additional operating costs force employers to economize\\nWhen faced with a minimum wage imposition, employers are forced to economize to offset the effects of increased labor expenses. One of the most obvious ways for employers to economize is by laying off their employees. This decision, forced upon the employer by the government, rules whether an employee gets to continue working at some politically detested market rate, or work zero hours at a rate determined by his benevolent representatives in office. \\n\\nIt may be the case that instead of laying off X number of employees, the employer decides to reduce employee benefits. Jobs will be saved, but employees will inevitably incur additional out-of-pocket expenses for having to replace their company-subsidized benefits, in part or in whole, with fully-priced benefits from other businessses. This is, of course, assuming that employees will want to retain their current level of benefits. Something else to consider is that there was incredible value in the company having spent the time researching and consolidating the array of benefit options into a convenient package from which employees could choose. This burden now rests with the employee.\\n\\nAlthough many large companies can afford to pay their employees a higher minimum wage--which is no justification for imposing one--small businesses are particularly burdened by this kind of legislation. A budding enterprise with little revenue and small profit is going to have a much harder time succeeding in the face of a minimum wage imposition than a company like Apple whose profits can readily absorb the increased operating costs. Consequently, smaller communities that thrive on small business will be hit hard by minimum wage laws. Think of how many businesses, *especially* small businesses, could benefit from hiring workers at a rate of $5 per hour. Employers would benefit from the low operating costs and the employees would benefit from gaining job experience and building up savings. So long as labor prices are prohibited from fluctuating freely, poor and unskilled individuals--the kinds of people who would benefit most from wages as low as $5, $4, or $3 per hour--have little hope for improving their current condition.  \\n\\nBusinesses don't always transfer increased operating costs onto their employees, but often times onto the everyday consumer. If a company won't lay off workers, reduce employee benefits, or make up the increased operating costs through some form of asset reallocation, they can always increase consumer prices. In this scenario, the consumer is primarily hurt since he must now spend more money to achieve an equivalent level of satisfaction. A secondary consequence of increased prices is that the consumer now has less money to spend on other goods, thereby depriving other businesses of revenue.\\n# The minimum wage is already hanging on by a thread\\nNo matter how you slice it, simple economics tells us that minimum wage laws are inherently destructive to all market participants and therefore ought to be repealed. Advocating for the abolition of the minimum wage does not mean you desire for people to make less money. As you'll see, the minimum wage affects such a small number of our population that it's repeal would have practiaclly no negative side effects.\\n\\n[Data](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that as of 2017, 97.7 percent of hourly paid workers are already making more than the federal minimum wage. Of the remaining 2.3 percent who make at or below the federal minimum wage level, roughly 66 percent are in the food service and preparation industry. Assuming that tips elevate this demographic above the minimum rate, it's actually the case that 99.2 percent of hourly paid workers are already making more than the minimum wage! Not only this, but the data on hourly wage rates does not take into account commission earnings, which would only increase the percentage of hourly wage workers who surpass the minimum wage.

Should minimum wage controls be abolsihed, large numbers of young and unskilled individuals would be able to find many more work opportunities, start saving money, and develop a set of transferrable skills.

Never\nagain will we have to work 12+ hours on a farm every day performing backbreaking\nlabor just to achieve subsistence living standards. If you haven't noticed, life\nin the 21st century is a bit more comfortable. To get a sense for just how\nproductive capitalism has made us, consider the fact that you can make a very\ncomfortable living live-streaming yourself playing video games or posting makeup\ntutorials on YouTube. Or, get this: you can spend your entire career lobbying to\nbreak up the very organizations whose products and services have provided\nimmeasurable value to nearly every inch of the globe.\n\nThis is the life of today's anti-trust politicians and lobbyists who have\nrecently focused turned their gaze towards the tech giants of Silicon Valley in\nan effort to investigate potentially \"anti-competitive behavior\"\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html].\nWashington is taking a divide-and-conquer approach to the whole ordeal, opting\nfor the Justice Department to administer investigations on Apple and Google,\nwhile the Federal Trade Commission is slated to deal with Facebook and Amazon.\n\nYou really have to marvel at the pompousness of the bureacurats in Washington.\nThey are essentially declaring, on behalf of hundreds of millions of satisfied\nconsumers, that companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple are too big\nand too dangerous for consumers, and therefore need to be broken up. Nevermind\nthe fact that hundreds of millions of people are happily doing business with\nthese companies on a daily basis. At the end of the day, Washington knows what's\nbest for us, and it is our job to listen.\n\nNot surprisingly, anti-big business sentiment permeates prominent businessmen as\nwell. Christ Hughes, co-founder of Facebook, recently published an op-ed\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?module=inline] \n earlier in May calling for the company's breakup. I strongly encourage anyone\nto read the op-ed, but to do so carefully; it is riddled with anti-big-business\nplatitudes, weak historical references, and makes little attempt at serious\neconomic analysis.\n\nTo give you an example, Hughes attempts to argue for Facebook's breakup using a \nbrief historical quip\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?module=inline] \n to reveal that the anti-trust lawsuits that broke up Standard Oil in the early\n1900s resulted in a doubling of its subsidiaries' profits within one year, and\nthen a fivefold increase in profits only a few years later. This was all he had\nto say about Standard Oil, and from this breif remark you might think it sounds\nlike a great idea, then, to break up Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. More profits\nfor the little guy, right?\n\nNow, it doesn't take a genius to intuit that breaking up Standard Oil would\nincrease the profits of its subsidiaries. It's fairly obvious that the cheif\norganizational entity takes the lion's share of the revenue, and that breaking\nit up will return that revenue to its subsidiaries and raise their profits. What\nis more telling is that Hughes's remarks conveniently ignored the fact that it\nwas because  of Standard's large scale operations (they operated roughly 30\nsmaller divisions) that society was able to benefit so greatly in the first\nplace! Hughes makes no attempt to recognize this fact.\n\nAn article [https://mises.org/library/truth-about-robber-barons]  written by\nThomas DiLorenzo paints the complete picture of Standrad Oil, demonstating that\nit was the very organizational structure and entrepreneurial ingenuity of\nStandard Oil that was responsible for drastcally cutting the price of oil\nrefinement. Standard's efficiency cut consumer oil prices from 30 cents per\ngallon in 1860 to just 8 cents per gallon by 1885, a 73 percent reduction! The\ngreatest irony of all is that by the time of the anti-trust lawsuits, Standard's\nmarket share had fallen by....this is due to competition forcing competitors to\nbecome more efficient...\n\nbreakup of standard benefited subsidiaries, but hurt the model that provided so\nmuch value to the consumer and the rest of society. We're supposed to believe\nthat Standard Oil could never  have gotten that big without destroying smaller\nbusinesses and squeezing every last drop out of consumers' wallets.This is the\nsame fear we're expected to have for today's tech giants unless the government.\n\nProper historical analysis flies directly in the face of those who cling to the\nsame surface-level narrative espoused by Chris Hughes. Not only were his\nStandard Oil claims grossly inadequate and misleading, but he exhibited the\npower hungry, ivory tower opinions that plague\n\nAt the end of the day, the fact of the matter is that none of the Silicon Valley\ntech giants got to where they are by forcing people to buy their products and\nuse their services. Hundreds of millions of people own iPhones, billions of\npeople use Facebook, you probably purchase at least one thing a month from\nAmazon, and use Google on the regular.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-06-05T11:38:48.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-07-19T15:33:28.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2019-06-05T11:41:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5d236deee7141a063cd9c301","uuid":"7c93a829-1707-43c0-9894-743daeafdd56","title":"For those crying \"equal pay!\" after the U.S women's team 2019 World Cup victory","slug":"for-those-crying-equal-pay-after-the-u-s-womens-team-2019-world-cup-victory","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Yes, despite the U.S women's team winning another World Cup&ndash;a truly exceptional feat, no dobut&ndash;the players deserve to be paid less than their male counterparts.

But is it really the case that this New York seller is just flat out greedy and exploitative? Or, is it possible that this seller is performing a valuable market function by conveying an intense shift in consumer demand? Basic economics tells us to bet on the latter.\\n\\n## What economics says price gouging is\\n\\n“Price gouging”, which is dramatically named, is nothing more than an intense shift in prices directly resulting from an intense shift in consumer demand. These prices do not manifest from a sudden desire to take advantage of consumers, but a realization on behalf of the seller that consumers are actually willing, under no threat of coercion, to voluntarily pay higher prices for particular goods. Price gouging turns out to be the one method that prevents shortages during times of crisis and, to the surprise of many, is a function of consumer demand as opposed to seller “greed.\\\"\\n\\n### The demand side of price gouging\\n\\nAs we all know, Purell has been extremely hard to find (except in places where it costs $50 per bottle) as COVID-19 continues to spread. And while some may see it as noble to force sellers to keep Purell prices low--and equally as noble to fine and/or imprison them for letting its price go up--doing so is a guarantee that the first round of consumers will wipe out the available supply of Purell before the second wave of consumers arrives. Artificially low prices will always encourage the first wave of consumers to stockpile and hoard unnecessary quantities of Purell at the expense of those who come after.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when the price of Purell is allowed to rise--even to what some would consider to be morally egregious levels--consumers, instead of hoarding and stockpiling Purell beyond their needs, are forced to economize and cut back on their consumption. This ensures that more Purell is available to a greater number of consumers, albeit at a greater price. Nevertheless, more consumers having at least one bottle of Purell is preferable to more consumers having none. This logic can, and ought to be, applied to all goods, especially in times of crisis.\\n\\n### The supply side of price gouging\\n\\nWe now have a very fundamental understanding of how price gouging more efficiently and justly allocates scarce resources across the consumer base. Fortunately, the case for price gouging is just as formidable when we examine it from the supply side. \\n\\nWhile high prices force consumers to economize and cut back on their consumption, these same price levels also serve as an incentive for sellers to ramp up their sales and, by extension, for manufacturers to increase production for the highly demanded goods in question.\\n\\nContinuing with our Purell example, the law of supply tells us that the price of Purell -- and all other  goods --  is directly related to the quantity supplied of that good. Thus, as consumers willingly drive up the price of Purell through a change in preference, sellers will become more eager to sell it for greater profit. We know that this profit is ethically procured from the fact that so many consumers are eagerly willing to buy Purell. As sellers become more eager to profit from Purell, manufacturers will likewise become more eager to invest in the factors of production used to create Purell, thus driving up the price for those factors of production. These increasing prices, all the way from the factors of production to the finished bottle of Purell on store shelves, signal the market to direct resources towards the creation and distribution of greater quantities of Purell. \\n\\nShould the government, through legislative fiat, mandate that the price of Purell stay below a certain level, the intensity of consumer demand for Purell is lost and cannot be transmitted up the structure of production. This ensures that the prices of the factors of production for Purell cannot increase. Under these circumstances, consumers cannot rationally expect manufacturers to increase their costs of production to churn out more bottles of Purell for the same price. As a manufacturer, it makes no sense to increase your costs of production if you are going to get the same revenue from your outputs. This practice will run you out of business, and then nobody ends up with Purell! Nevertheless, under anti-price gouging laws, manufacturers are stuck at a decreased level of Purell production while consumers are wiping it off the shelves.\\n\\n## Do we need to worry about greed?\\n\\nThe bottom line is that when sellers charge high prices for goods, it is because they are matching the intensity with which consumers are demanding those goods. In a free market, high prices are a result of an increased demand for the factors of production which ultimately have their root in an increased demand for a finished good on behalf of the *consumer.*  If consumers wanted to pay $5,000 for a bottle of Purell, in what world does it make sense to be mad at the seller for charging that price? Either consumers voluntarily purchase Purell at $5,000 per bottle, or the price falls to meet consumer demand. If the seller refuses to lower prices, no sales will be made and the seller will quickly go out if business.\\n\\nEarlier in this article I mentioned that economics tells us not to bet on the fact that high prices are a result of seller greed. But what if sellers started to charge $500,000 or $10 million for a bottle of Purell? Isn't that proof that the price of Purell is motivated by seller greed? Maybe so, but this is nothing to worry about. Again, if nobody is willing to voluntarily purchase a bottle of Purell for $10 million, then the seller must lower its prices or go out of business. Clearly, the concern of seller greed is irrelevant when prices are allowed to fluctuate freely. This reminds us that voluntary transactions at any price level--even “price gouging” levels--are always beneficial to both buyer and seller. If this wasn't the case, no transaction would occur.\\n\\nWhile high prices during times of crisis can seem unethical and unjustifiable, we need to remember that they ultimately a function of *consumer* demand, not seller greed. Sellers are simply messengers whose job is to convey consumer demand by changing prices to reflect the intensity with which consumers do, or do not want, a particular good. Letting prices rise maximizes consumer satisfaction by ensuring that the supply of a particular good isn’t wiped out in a matter of days, or to the contrary, left sitting on the shelves for weeks on end. Should panic continue to spread over COVID-19 and prices continue to rise, it is my hope that you can now see why harboring anger towards sellers is no different than shooting the messenger.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Amidst the continued spread of COVID-19, anti-price gougers have been hard at work on social media to expose the supposed moral tragedy of price gouging: greedy and exploitative sellers raising the prices of necessary goods to massive heights when consumers need them most.

Take the following tweet as an example:\n\nThis store in NYC was fined for price gouging. Was selling 8 ounce purell, which\nbefore all of this sold for $2.50, for $50 each, a 1900% increase (via \n@ninapineda7 [https://twitter.com/ninapineda7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]) \npic.twitter.com/YAnCQv6X4j [https://t.co/YAnCQv6X4j]\n\n— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) March 13, 2020\n[https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1238488612058128386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] \n This tweet is meant to tug on our heartstrings so that we pour out our\ngrievances for the every-day consumer and harbor anger towards price-gouging\nsellers. But is it really the case that this New York seller is just flat out\ngreedy and exploitative? Or, is it possible that this seller is performing a\nvaluable market function by conveying an intense shift in consumer demand? Basic\neconomics tells us to bet on the latter.\n\nWhat economics says price gouging is\n“Price gouging”, which is dramatically named, is nothing more than an intense\nshift in prices directly resulting from an intense shift in consumer demand.\nThese prices do not manifest from a sudden desire to take advantage of\nconsumers, but a realization on behalf of the seller that consumers are actually\nwilling, under no threat of coercion, to voluntarily pay higher prices for\nparticular goods. Price gouging turns out to be the one method that prevents\nshortages during times of crisis and, to the surprise of many, is a function of\nconsumer demand as opposed to seller “greed.\"\n\nThe demand side of price gouging\nAs we all know, Purell has been extremely hard to find (except in places where\nit costs $50 per bottle) as COVID-19 continues to spread. And while some may see\nit as noble to force sellers to keep Purell prices low--and equally as noble to\nfine and/or imprison them for letting its price go up--doing so is a guarantee\nthat the first round of consumers will wipe out the available supply of Purell\nbefore the second wave of consumers arrives. Artificially low prices will always\nencourage the first wave of consumers to stockpile and hoard unnecessary\nquantities of Purell at the expense of those who come after.\n\nOn the other hand, when the price of Purell is allowed to rise--even to what\nsome would consider to be morally egregious levels--consumers, instead of\nhoarding and stockpiling Purell beyond their needs, are forced to economize and\ncut back on their consumption. This ensures that more Purell is available to a\ngreater number of consumers, albeit at a greater price. Nevertheless, more\nconsumers having at least one bottle of Purell is preferable to more consumers\nhaving none. This logic can, and ought to be, applied to all goods, especially\nin times of crisis.\n\nThe supply side of price gouging\nWe now have a very fundamental understanding of how price gouging more\nefficiently and justly allocates scarce resources across the consumer base.\nFortunately, the case for price gouging is just as formidable when we examine it\nfrom the supply side.\n\nWhile high prices force consumers to economize and cut back on their\nconsumption, these same price levels also serve as an incentive for sellers to\nramp up their sales and, by extension, for manufacturers to increase production\nfor the highly demanded goods in question.\n\nContinuing with our Purell example, the law of supply tells us that the price of\nPurell -- and all other goods -- is directly related to the quantity supplied of\nthat good. Thus, as consumers willingly drive up the price of Purell through a\nchange in preference, sellers will become more eager to sell it for greater\nprofit. We know that this profit is ethically procured from the fact that so\nmany consumers are eagerly willing to buy Purell. As sellers become more eager\nto profit from Purell, manufacturers will likewise become more eager to invest\nin the factors of production used to create Purell, thus driving up the price\nfor those factors of production. These increasing prices, all the way from the\nfactors of production to the finished bottle of Purell on store shelves, signal\nthe market to direct resources towards the creation and distribution of greater\nquantities of Purell.\n\nShould the government, through legislative fiat, mandate that the price of\nPurell stay below a certain level, the intensity of consumer demand for Purell\nis lost and cannot be transmitted up the structure of production. This ensures\nthat the prices of the factors of production for Purell cannot increase.

This\npractice will run you out of business, and then nobody ends up with Purell!\nNevertheless, under anti-price gouging laws, manufacturers are stuck at a\ndecreased level of Purell production while consumers are wiping it off the\nshelves.\n\nDo we need to worry about greed?\nThe bottom line is that when sellers charge high prices for goods, it is because\nthey are matching the intensity with which consumers are demanding those goods.\nIn a free market, high prices are a result of an increased demand for the\nfactors of production which ultimately have their root in an increased demand\nfor a finished good on behalf of the consumer.

How many people, in the face of economic panic, have\nknelt before our elected officials and financial authorities, yearning to be led\nout of this crisis and made secure in their livelihoods? How many people have\ntaken comfort in the small amount of safety that comes from knowing that\nmillions are not allowed to go to work and support their families, or leave\ntheir homes for anything other than what the state deems necessary? How many\nhave taken comfort in knowing that the police, in complete violation of the\nfourth amendment, are conducting unwarranted searches\n[https://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-door-to-door-searches-new-yorkers/] \nfor civilians not following quarantine mandates? How many have gained a sense of\npeace in the idea of forced checkpoints\n[https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-coronavirus-border-checkpoints-nyc-louisiana-self-quarantine-60-days-jail] \n and the ability of the state to dictate what companies ought to produce\n[https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/trump-slams-gm-over-ventilator-production-delays-costs-151885]\n? How many people have taken comfort in their measly, expropriated share of the\n$2 trillion stimulus package? And how many people have marveled at the state's\npower to indefinitely shut down the economy and bring millions of lives to a\nhalt?\n\nIt appears we live in a nation of people who have chosen to dismiss, or are\nblissfully ignorant of, the wealth of historical evidence--expertly documented\nin Robert Higgs' Crisis and Leviathan\n[https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Leviathan-Government-Anniversary-Independent/dp/1598131117]\n--which lays bare the state's tradition of arrogating unwarranted powers during\ncrises and emergencies, powers that never fully recede from the state's arsenal\nof economic and political manipulation.\n\nIt is likely that we simply can't conceive of our public servants and their\n\"experts\" as being capable of wreaking nationwide political and economic\ndestruction. \"This is the United States,\" we say, \"our dear leaders won't let\nthings get that  bad!\"\n\nThe question of whether or not private citizens are permitted to keep their\n\"non-essential\" businesses open, go to work, or attend church isn't even up for\ndebate. We can only hope that the state will continue to permit us to do certain\nthings, and then shrug our shoulders with mumbles of \"Well, that's the price we\nhave to pay\" as more of our freedoms become restricted. In the meantime, we are\nto do as our elected officials and their experts have told us, because our\nunquestioned obedience is necessary to secure our safety.\n\nPrivate citizens are too irrational and un-predictable to handle this pandemic\non their own. Without local, state, or federal mandates, how could we ever\nunderstand the importance of choosing to stay at home and distancing ourselves\nto prevent the spread of infection? How could any group of private actors\npossibly devise a more efficient and effective solution for the COVID-19\npandemic than our wise experts? It simply cannot happen, especially in a nation\nwhose private enterprises have solved countless problems to catapult living\nstandards to the highest degree ever attained in all of human history, and have\ngiven us just about every modern technological advancement and luxury that we'd\ngo crazy to live without. Only a fool would suggest that the private sector is\ncapable of tackling this crisis.\n\nOur nation's predictable response\nSadly, as is the pattern with every national crisis, the fallout of our nation's\neconomic and political decline will be met with cries for more government\nintervention in our economy, an economy whose impending recession\n[https://fee.org/articles/covid-19-isn-t-the-true-culprit-of-the-coming-recession/] \n only stands to be accelerated by this virus.\n\nNo doubt there will also be cries for additional regulation on behalf of the\ninstitutions whose laws have hindered\n[https://fee.org/articles/the-fda-is-still-undermining-coronavirus-response-efforts/] \n the resourcefulness and productivity of the market's response to this crisis.\n\nPerhaps most important will be the neglect of the true culprit behind our\neconomy's poor health, The Federal Reserve: the most unaccountable, most\ninfluential, and therefore the most dangerous financial institution in the\nUnited States. Directed by its presidentially appointed Chairman, the monetary\nschemes of the Federal Reserve stand completely  removed from any trace of\ndemocratic accountability.\n\nAdding insult to injury, very few people care to understand the deep\ninterconnectedeness between the Federal Reserve, the big banks, and the United\nStates Treasury. The Federal Reserve enjoys a totally unbridled monopoly on\ninterest rate manipulation and the money supply, a power that terrifies far too\nfew people.\n\nFortunately, the Austrian School of economists has correctly focused blame for\nthe Great Depression, the Dot Com crash at the turn of the 21st century, and the\nhousing crisis of 2008 and 2009 on the Federal Reserve and its manipulation of\ninterest rates and generation of abundantly cheap credit.\n\nIt was also the Austrian economists who predicted these recessions, giving\nimmense credibility to their teachings on the business cycle\n[https://mises.org/wire/austrian-business-cycle-theory-explained], which are\nmore valuable now than ever. Our understanding of the coming recession will be\nkey in determining whether or not more restraints and regulations will creep\ntheir way into our every-day lives.\n\nNevertheless, the Federal Reserve, by continuing to engage in the same type of\nmonetary policy\n[https://mises.org/wire/coronavirus-central-banks-stand-ready-more-stimulus] \nthat has weakened our economy leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak, has set the\nstage for a tremendous recession, a recession that will impoverish far more\nindividuals than have been hurt by our economy's shut down, and to a much\ngreater extent.\n\nAnd if the pattern holds, we can expect a vast majority of people, when severe\nrecession settles in, to turn to the Federal Reserve and other state officials\nfor economic salvation.\n\nHow much are we willing to give?\nAs Larry Reed made clear\n[https://fee.org/articles/a-nation-s-true-test-comes-after-the-crisis/], our\nnation's true test is yet to come. When the crisis is over, we will be able to\nfully assess, as Reed notes, the extent of the measures taken to combat the\nvirus; we will gain a much clearer picture of just how far the state overstepped\nits supposed bounds. That is why we should ever be on guard against the state's\narrogation of unwarranted powers, especially in light of what history has shown\nthe state is capable of doing in times of emergency. Once certain freedoms have\nbeen forfeited, that forfeiture will always serve as the precedent for future\npower grabs.\n\nWe have already given up the freedom to work and provide for our families, the\nright to avoid inspection without presumption of having committed a crime, the\nright to go to church, and the right to travel at certain hours and to certain\nlocations without the threat of facing arrest and/or imprisonment. We have\nallowed the state to determine whose livelihoods are \"essential\" and whose are\n\"non-essential\", and we will sooner look to the state to resolve the fallout of\nthe economic destruction that is yet to come.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-03-30T12:09:31.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2020-04-01T12:16:00.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2020-03-31T14:50:33.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5ea9f366e7141a063cd9c36e","uuid":"532bc519-b8f6-462b-9eea-389f65e5922f","title":"(Untitled)","slug":"the-greatest-political-blunder-of-our-time","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"></div>","amp":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-04-29T21:36:38.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2020-04-29T23:07:09.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5eaa0b8fe7141a063cd9c370","uuid":"ebf1f662-ce24-4840-9346-c9a97ac31a47","title":"(Untitled)","slug":"a-call-for-return-to-normalcy","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"></div>","amp":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-04-29T23:19:43.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2020-05-02T23:17:55.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2020-04-30T00:09:30.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5eaf0ce4e7141a063cd9c379","uuid":"e6784291-029e-48fd-9fe5-59b3ae7def93","title":"What Is So Different This Time Around?","slug":"the-one-question-lockdowners-cant-answer","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"# The Current Culture War\\n\\nThere is no denying that we are in the midst of an intense and passionately debated culture war.

Quite frankly, life went on without a hitch. \\n\\nJeffrey Tucker, editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research [highlights the fact](https://www.aier.org/article/woodstock-occurred-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/) that if we were able to extrapolate the 1968 flu death toll to today's much larger and generally unhealthier population, it is very likely that almost a quarter of a million people would have died.\\n\\nMost crucially in his article, Tucker notes that \\n> Stock markets didn’t crash. Congress passed no legislation. The Federal Reserve did nothing. Not a single governor acted to enforce social distancing, curve flattening (even though hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized), or banning of crowds. No mothers were arrested for taking their kids to other homes. No surfers were arrested. No daycares were shut even though there were more infant deaths with this virus than the one we are experiencing now. There were no suicides, no unemployment, no drug overdoses. . .Media covered the pandemic but it never became a big issue.\\n\\nBy no metric was the flu epidemic any worse in 1968 than the Coronavirus epidemic of 2020. So if Lockdown Hysteria failed to rear its ugly head in 1968, what is different this time around? What suddenly makes the [72,000 projected deaths](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates) (as of 4/29/2020) the new standard by which governors can assume the authority to lock down their populations and force millions into unemployment? \\n\\nConsider also that during the 2017-2018 flu season there were an estimated [61,000 deaths and 800,000 hospitalizations](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018/archive.htm#table1), the equivalent of 15,250 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations every 3 months. Where was Lockdown Hysteria when these 15,250 lives were being lost? Where was the medical resource redistribution when we needed 67,000 hospital beds each month? Was this number just too small for the Lockdowners to care? \\n\\nTrying to understand the Lockdowners' death threshold becomes particularly difficult when we consider the most recent climate scare. As one recalls, the entirety of the Earth's 7.6 billion inhabitants was supposed to be wiped out in 12 years. If the equivalent of 162,500,000 deaths every 3 months wasn't enough to implement lockdown measures or travel bans to reduce our carbon footprint, there is really no discernible death threshold after which Lockdowners can justify the implementation of government-mandated lockdowns.\\n\\n# The Burden Of Proof Is On The Lockdowners\\n\\nAny mention of wanting to reopen the economy will earn you the label of a murderer by the Lockdowners.

They recognize that the economic\npressures resulting from mass government-mandated unemployment and centralized\ndistribution of medical resources stand to cause far more deaths than the\nCoronavirus itself.\n\nOur economy is not just an amalgam of haircuts, cheeseburgers, and booze. It is\nthe result of brilliant entrepreneurial risk-taking, innovation, and the\nvoluntary interactions of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their\nown dreams and passions. All of them depend on the economy's continued and\nunhindered operation to sustain themselves and their loved ones and achieve a\nlife filled with meaning and purpose. A return to normalcy means that we can\ncontinue to work towards these things by exercising our fundamental right to\nself-determination, even if that means incurring some risk.\n\nThe Data Won't Convince Them\nIn the fight for a return to normalcy, you can point to articles\n[https://www.foxnews.com/media/california-doctor-questions-stay-at-home-orders] \nhighlighting the importance of establishing herd immunity; to warnings\n[http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/april/19/the-unseen-death-toll-of-covid-19-measures/] \n of the death and starvation that will come from destroying countless\nlivelihoods and diverting medical resources away from patients with\nlife-threatening illnesses; to articles\n[https://fee.org/articles/sweden-s-top-epidemiologist-covid-19-infections-flattening-under-policy-of-individual-responsibility/] \n showing the success of the Swedish government's laissez-faire approach in\ntrusting the rationality and responsibility of their people; to pieces\n[https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation] \n calling attention to the fact that we only really needed to seriously consider\nquarantining the elderly and those with underlying illness; to graphs\n[https://twitter.com/WriterRomana/status/1255298101767737344?s=20]  suggesting\nthe inflation of death counts attributable to COVID-19; or to articles\n[https://fee.org/articles/confronting-the-leviathan-of-the-covid-19-crisis/] \ndecrying one the government's arrogation of unprecedented powers.\n\nWhile these findings suggest that the most rational approach is to call for an\nimmediate end to the lockdowns, the only piece of data that seems relevant to\nthe Lockdowners is the COVID-19 death toll.\n\nThe Question No Lockdowner Can Answer\nAlthough these arguments and all the questions they pose may fail to shift a\nLockdowner's perspective, there is one important question to which they cannot\ngive an answer: How high does a death projection need to be before you start\nimplementing lockdown measures?\n\nMany seem to forget that we have lived through a pandemic every bit as severe as\nthe one we are living through today, but with no hint of a lockdown. This\ndescribes the year 1968, in which a deadly flu epidemic made its way across the\nUnited States, killing roughly 100,000\n[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html]  Americans.\n\nNobody was thrown in jail for surfing. No helicopters were patrolling beaches\n[https://twitter.com/michaeljknowles/status/1257031573024567296]  ordering\npeople to stay off of them. No politicians were encouraging snitching on those\nnot following social distancing mandates\n[https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1251496378372632577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1251496378372632577&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fde-blasio-urges-new-yorkers-to-snitch-on-social-distance-rule-breakers%2F]\n. All businesses stayed open. Quite frankly, life went on without a hitch.\n\nJeffrey Tucker, editorial director of the American Institute for Economic\nResearch highlights the fact\n[https://www.aier.org/article/woodstock-occurred-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/] \nthat if we were able to extrapolate the 1968 flu death toll to today's much\nlarger and generally unhealthier population, it is very likely that almost a\nquarter of a million people would have died.\n\nMost crucially in his article, Tucker notes that\n\nStock markets didn’t crash. Congress passed no legislation. The Federal Reserve\ndid nothing. Not a single governor acted to enforce social distancing, curve\nflattening (even though hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized), or\nbanning of crowds. No mothers were arrested for taking their kids to other\nhomes. No surfers were arrested. No daycares were shut even though there were\nmore infant deaths with this virus than the one we are experiencing now. There\nwere no suicides, no unemployment, no drug overdoses. . .Media covered the\npandemic but it never became a big issue.\n\nBy no metric was the flu epidemic any worse in 1968 than the Coronavirus\nepidemic of 2020. So if Lockdown Hysteria failed to rear its ugly head in 1968,\nwhat is different this time around? What suddenly makes the 72,000 projected\ndeaths [http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates]  (as of 4/29/2020) the new\nstandard by which governors can assume the authority to lock down their\npopulations and force millions into unemployment?\n\nConsider also that during the 2017-2018 flu season there were an estimated \n61,000 deaths and 800,000 hospitalizations, the equivalent of 15,250 deaths and\n200,000 hospitalizations every 3 months. Where was Lockdown Hysteria when these\n15,250 lives were being lost? Where was the medical resource redistribution when\nwe needed 67,000 hospital beds each month? Was this number just too small for\nthe Lockdowners to care?\n\nTrying to understand the Lockdowners' death threshold becomes particularly\ndifficult when we consider the most recent climate scare. As one recalls, the\nentirety of the Earth's 7.6 billion inhabitants was supposed to be wiped out in\n12 years. If the equivalent of 162,500,000 deaths every 3 months wasn't enough\nto implement lockdown measures or travel bans to reduce our carbon footprint,\nthere is really no discernible death threshold after which Lockdowners can\njustify the implementation of government-mandated lockdowns.\n\nThe Burden Of Proof Is On The Lockdowners\nAny mention of wanting to reopen the economy will earn you the label of a\nmurderer by the Lockdowners. Every restaurant meal you eat, every movie you see,\nand every drink you have at a bar is one more COVID-19 death. Any effort to\npublicly protest one of the most egregious government power grabs of our time\nmakes you a biological terrorist, at least according to screenwriter Mark\nHughes.\n\nThese are white nationalist terrorists, they are overtly intentionally trying to\nspread a disease in public & threatening to shoot people. They should be treated\nexactly like any other terrorists who did this sort of deranged homicidal\nbullshit.\n\n— Mark Hughes (@markhughesfilms) April 30, 2020\n[https://twitter.com/markhughesfilms/status/1255918186685321217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] \n No matter what label the Lockdowners ascribe to you, the fact of the matter is\nthat the burden of proof is on them to tell you why things are different this\ntime around, especially in light of the government's non-involvement in the\nequally deadly 1968 flu pandemic. No Lockdowner, apart from pure arbitration can\ntell you the number of projected deaths necessary to implement lockdown\nmeasures.

Imagine being refused the keys to a vehicle you just purchased solely because the car dealership claimed they had no obligation to hand you the keys to the car you've just purchased. Anybody would surely sue this dealership, publicize their horrible business practices, and immediately take their patronage elsewhere.\\n\\n# Problem #2: No competition allowed\\n\\nThis brings us to the second major problem with the state-funded police: the prohibition of competing police forces. \\n\\nCompetition gives rise to the abundance of different products and services available to us. It encourages innovation, cost-cutting, day-to-day efficiency, and friendly customer service. Business that do a better job of implementing these things are going to satisfy a greater number of consumers and be rewarded with larger revenue and increased profits. The moment consumers become dissatisfied with a business for any reason, they file complaints, leave negative reviews, request refunds and returns, or take their patronage elsewhere. As a business owner, refusing to correct any inefficiencies, ignoring customer feedback, or ceasing to innovate is an open invitation for another business to take your place. That is why free markets present us with a tremendous amount of flexibility and an overflow of choices that allow us to seamlessly switch between products and services to satisfy our ever-changing preferences.\\n\\nBut rather than subjecting government police forces to the same mechanisms that make market economies so competitive and flowing with choice--freedom of entry, the profit and loss mechanism, competitive innovation, and the desire to reduce business costs--there is no question that a majority of the nation believes it is the sacrosanct duty of the state alone to provide us with police protection. And why should it be? Policing services are no more unique than any other service, nor are they too complicated for the world's most technologically advanced and innovative private sector. \\n\\nAren't businesses, apartment complexes, neighborhoods, and other service providers--key stakeholders in a community's well-being--strongly incentivised to provide policing services so that customers can safely patronize their businesses and individuals can feel safe in their apartments and neighborhoods?\\n\\nIs there any objection to the obvious fact that the incentive for community stakeholders to offer policing services would be met with an equal demand for security on behalf of individual consumers and property owners, none of whom desire to live in unsafe neighborhoods or shop in dangerous communities? Whatever private police forces may *look* like, the only relevant question is whether or not there is a demand for these services. As long as the demand exists, and it always will, market entrepreneurship will take care of the rest.\\n\\n\\n# Problem #3: Political Moral Hazard\\nMoral hazard is introduced when individuals are incentivised to engage in questionable behavior without fear of suffering its potential consequences. \\n\\nThe doctrine of [qualified immunity](https://www.cato.org/blog/why-qualified-immunity) is quite possibly the biggest contributer to moral hazard in the policing community. Simply put, qualified immunity allows police officers--and other state officials--to avoid accountability for undeniably illegal and grossly immoral practices so long as their very specific circumstances and practices haven't been strictly ruled on in a prior court proceeding. Clark Neily [describes](https://www.cato.org/blog/officer-involved-killing-george-floyd) how this doctrine could be used to have George Floyd's case quickly tossed out of court:\\n\\n>if Mr. Floyd’s family wants to sue the officer who took his life, they will need to find an existing case from the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals holding that a police officer may not kneel on a unresisting suspect’s neck, ignoring his pleas for help, until he passes out. If no such case happens to be on the books, their case will be summarily tossed out of court. Such is the perversity of the Supreme Court’s qualified immunity doctrine.\\n\\nWithout a specific prior ruling on the exact circumstances and brutal methods of law enforcement, the doctrine of qualified immunity can be used to excuse a seemingly endless number of grossly immoral and over-aggressive policing behaviors. What private policing service could expect to gain any customers when right up their sleeve is the ability to dismiss any claims brought against their employees for abuses of power?\\n\\n## Problem #4: Economic Moral Hazard\\n\\nIn addition to qualified immunity, all government-run businesses and government-granted monopolies, including police departments, face the moral hazard of being severed from the profit and loss mechanisms of the market.\\n\\nThe very simple metrics of profit and loss determine how successful business are in meeting the needs of consumers. Private enterprises that waste resources, drive away customers with poor service, or refuse to tailor their products and services to meet consumer demand will quickly find themselves losing revenue as consumers decide to patronize the more profitable, i.e. successful, businesses.\\n\\nPolice departments, being financially secured through taxation and, as a last resort the printing press, face no financial consequences for squandering resources, failing to cut costs, refusing to innovate, or wrongfully killing one of their constituents. This is because the continued operation of police departments is not contingent upon the voluntary patronage of its citizens. No amount of consumer dissatisfaction, resource waste, or business malpractice will lead to a loss of revenue that would force departments to rethink their allocation of resources or business practices.\\n\\n# There was no reason for George Floyd to die\\n\\nOne can only wonder whether George Floyd would have died if his arrest had been carried out by a privatized police force that was (1) held accountable to the profit and loss system, (2) was in constant competition with other agencies for providing the most just and peaceful means of dispute resolution, (3) wasn't anointed with the doctrine of qualified immunity, and (4) did not have to lay a hefty fine and/or imprison non-violent persons for using a forged $20 bill.\\n\\nWe live in the world's most technologically advanced and competitive economy. Normal human beings will always demand protection for themselves, their families, and their property.

As a business owner, refusing to correct any inefficiencies, ignoring\ncustomer feedback, or ceasing to innovate is an open invitation for another\nbusiness to take your place. That is why free markets present us with a\ntremendous amount of flexibility and an overflow of choices that allow us to\nseamlessly switch between products and services to satisfy our ever-changing\npreferences.\n\nBut rather than subjecting government police forces to the same mechanisms that\nmake market economies so competitive and flowing with choice--freedom of entry,\nthe profit and loss mechanism, competitive innovation, and the desire to reduce\nbusiness costs--there is no question that a majority of the nation believes it\nis the sacrosanct duty of the state alone to provide us with police protection.\nAnd why should it be? Policing services are no more unique than any other\nservice, nor are they too complicated for the world's most technologically\nadvanced and innovative private sector.\n\nAren't businesses, apartment complexes, neighborhoods, and other service\nproviders--key stakeholders in a community's well-being--strongly incentivised\nto provide policing services so that customers can safely patronize their\nbusinesses and individuals can feel safe in their apartments and neighborhoods?\n\nIs there any objection to the obvious fact that the incentive for community\nstakeholders to offer policing services would be met with an equal demand for\nsecurity on behalf of individual consumers and property owners, none of whom\ndesire to live in unsafe neighborhoods or shop in dangerous communities?\nWhatever private police forces may look  like, the only relevant question is\nwhether or not there is a demand for these services. As long as the demand\nexists, and it always will, market entrepreneurship will take care of the rest.\n\nProblem #3: Political Moral Hazard\nMoral hazard is introduced when individuals are incentivised to engage in\nquestionable behavior without fear of suffering its potential consequences.\n\nThe doctrine of qualified immunity\n[https://www.cato.org/blog/why-qualified-immunity]  is quite possibly the\nbiggest contributer to moral hazard in the policing community. Simply put,\nqualified immunity allows police officers--and other state officials--to avoid\naccountability for undeniably illegal and grossly immoral practices so long as\ntheir very specific circumstances and practices haven't been strictly ruled on\nin a prior court proceeding. Clark Neily describes\n[https://www.cato.org/blog/officer-involved-killing-george-floyd]  how this\ndoctrine could be used to have George Floyd's case quickly tossed out of court:\n\nif Mr. Floyd’s family wants to sue the officer who took his life, they will need\nto find an existing case from the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals holding\nthat a police officer may not kneel on a unresisting suspect’s neck, ignoring\nhis pleas for help, until he passes out. If no such case happens to be on the\nbooks, their case will be summarily tossed out of court. Such is the perversity\nof the Supreme Court’s qualified immunity doctrine.\n\nWithout a specific prior ruling on the exact circumstances and brutal methods of\nlaw enforcement, the doctrine of qualified immunity can be used to excuse a\nseemingly endless number of grossly immoral and over-aggressive policing\nbehaviors. What private policing service could expect to gain any customers when\nright up their sleeve is the ability to dismiss any claims brought against their\nemployees for abuses of power?\n\nProblem #4: Economic Moral Hazard\nIn addition to qualified immunity, all government-run businesses and\ngovernment-granted monopolies, including police departments, face the moral\nhazard of being severed from the profit and loss mechanisms of the market.\n\nThe very simple metrics of profit and loss determine how successful business are\nin meeting the needs of consumers. Private enterprises that waste resources,\ndrive away customers with poor service, or refuse to tailor their products and\nservices to meet consumer demand will quickly find themselves losing revenue as\nconsumers decide to patronize the more profitable, i.e. successful, businesses.\n\nPolice departments, being financially secured through taxation and, as a last\nresort the printing press, face no financial consequences for squandering\nresources, failing to cut costs, refusing to innovate, or wrongfully killing one\nof their constituents. This is because the continued operation of police\ndepartments is not contingent upon the voluntary patronage of its citizens. No\namount of consumer dissatisfaction, resource waste, or business malpractice will\nlead to a loss of revenue that would force departments to rethink their\nallocation of resources or business practices.\n\nThere was no reason for George Floyd to die\nOne can only wonder whether George Floyd would have died if his arrest had been\ncarried out by a privatized police force that was (1) held accountable to the\nprofit and loss system, (2) was in constant competition with other agencies for\nproviding the most just and peaceful means of dispute resolution, (3) wasn't\nanointed with the doctrine of qualified immunity, and (4) did not have to lay a\nhefty fine and/or imprison non-violent persons for using a forged $20 bill.\n\nWe live in the world's most technologically advanced and competitive economy.\nNormal human beings will always demand protection for themselves, their\nfamilies, and their property. Amidst all the protests and dissatisfaction with\nstate police forces, now is the perfect time for the free market to assume the\nduty of policing our communities.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-05-27T02:47:04.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2020-05-31T15:44:15.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2020-05-27T03:32:47.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null}],"posts_authors":[{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf89487d","post_id":"5a9345f007fa5c102abc0c46","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf89487e","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c47","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf89487f","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c48","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf894880","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c49","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf894881","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4a","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf894882","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4b","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf894883","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4c","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf894884","post_id":"5a937a82d2a2b710803d5a67","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5a6b9d94611d3eaf894886","post_id":"5b5a6b9c94611d3eaf894885","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5ba06ba9f35b48eb0dfda0","post_id":"5b5ba06ba9f35b48eb0dfd9f","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b5ccfe67b7e444ba2485b50","post_id":"5b5ccfe67b7e444ba2485b4f","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b734b877b7e444ba2485b76","post_id":"5b734b877b7e444ba2485b75","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5b97d0eb7b7e444ba2485b7f","post_id":"5b97d0eb7b7e444ba2485b7e","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5bc92bc57b7e444ba2485b87","post_id":"5bc92bc57b7e444ba2485b86","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5c6d9a24e7141a063cd9c2c0","post_id":"5c6d9a24e7141a063cd9c2bf","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5cb5ca95e7141a063cd9c2e6","post_id":"5cb5ca95e7141a063cd9c2e5","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5cf7a9c8e7141a063cd9c2f4","post_id":"5cf7a9c8e7141a063cd9c2f3","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5d236deee7141a063cd9c302","post_id":"5d236deee7141a063cd9c301","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5ded58efe7141a063cd9c310","post_id":"5ded58efe7141a063cd9c30f","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5deee43ae7141a063cd9c316","post_id":"5deee43ae7141a063cd9c315","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e1522afe7141a063cd9c31d","post_id":"5e1522afe7141a063cd9c31c","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e6d0f9ae7141a063cd9c328","post_id":"5e6d0f9ae7141a063cd9c327","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e723c98e7141a063cd9c33d","post_id":"5e723c98e7141a063cd9c33c","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e7357bde7141a063cd9c33f","post_id":"5e7357bde7141a063cd9c33e","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e74bc48e7141a063cd9c343","post_id":"5e74bc48e7141a063cd9c342","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e74e2dbe7141a063cd9c345","post_id":"5e74e2dbe7141a063cd9c344","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e75029ce7141a063cd9c348","post_id":"5e75029ce7141a063cd9c347","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e78994be7141a063cd9c34c","post_id":"5e78994be7141a063cd9c34b","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e7ce847e7141a063cd9c355","post_id":"5e7ce847e7141a063cd9c354","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e7e7d39e7141a063cd9c359","post_id":"5e7e7d39e7141a063cd9c358","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5e81e17be7141a063cd9c35f","post_id":"5e81e17be7141a063cd9c35e","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5ea9f366e7141a063cd9c36f","post_id":"5ea9f366e7141a063cd9c36e","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5eaa0b8fe7141a063cd9c371","post_id":"5eaa0b8fe7141a063cd9c370","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5eaf0ce4e7141a063cd9c37a","post_id":"5eaf0ce4e7141a063cd9c379","author_id":"1","sort_order":0},{"id":"5ecdd4a8e7141a063cd9c38a","post_id":"5ecdd4a8e7141a063cd9c389","author_id":"1","sort_order":0}],"posts_tags":[{"id":"5a9345f407fa5c102abc0d07","post_id":"5a9345f007fa5c102abc0c46","tag_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4d","sort_order":0},{"id":"5a9345f407fa5c102abc0d08","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c47","tag_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4d","sort_order":0},{"id":"5a9345f407fa5c102abc0d09","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c48","tag_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4d","sort_order":0},{"id":"5a9345f507fa5c102abc0d0a","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c49","tag_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4d","sort_order":0},{"id":"5a9345f507fa5c102abc0d0b","post_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4a","tag_id":"5a9345f107fa5c102abc0c4d","sort_order":0},{"id":"5a9345f507fa5c102abc0d0c","post_
