# INTRO

- don't hear much about gender wage gap....thoroughly debunked over public airwaves/debates.....nonbody tries to argue for it because it has been so thoroughly debunked
- we are almost there with the Covid narrative, those dissenting from the official narrative have been censored and publicly ridiculed for their supposed selfishness and lack of concern for humanity. On the other hand, propagators of the establishmet-approved narrative find their voices echoing across all major media airwaves and social media platforms, shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies.
- despite numbers that are worse now than the first half of 2020, governors are suddenly pushing for the reopening of their economies and easing restrictions on gathering sizes. In particular, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy [recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1356998994006794243?s=20) that on Feburary 5, gyms and restaurants can increase capacity to 35% while indoor performance venues and indoor gatherings for activities such as weddings or political events can host up to 150 people. This announcement comes at a time when New Jersey has higher case counts, deaths, and hospitalizations than it did during the entire stretch from June to October, where more severe restrictions were in place. Responses to Murphy's tweet show that the covid-panicked population is hardly pleased with his move back towards normalcy, and would rather remain in their social bonds that channel a sense of safety.
