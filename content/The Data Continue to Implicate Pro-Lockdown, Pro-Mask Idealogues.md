It isn't often we get to witness esteemed public health experts falter when the science behind lockdowns and mask mandates are called into question. A couple of months ago White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt [fumbled](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) for an explanation during an MSNBC interview as to why Florida, a state that had been fully open since September, was seeing [lower hospitalizations per million](https://cdn.mises.org/roz1.png) and [lower age-adjusted deaths per million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExvLaPnWUAU14K-?format=jpg&name=large) than California, which has suffered one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the country. Not too long after this interview, in which Slavitt was reduced to empty platitudes about wearing masks and social distancing, the establishment's sainted health expert Dr. Anthony Facui recently [expressed](https://twitter.com/Izzy_B911/status/1381071918502141952?s=20) confusion during an MSNBC interview when remarking that he wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas is still experiencing falling cases and deaths one month after having lifted their statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions&mdash;remember, the effects of easing restrictions are supposed to be clearly visible after only two weeks. 

The Fauci and Slavitt itnerviews should serve as sobering reminders of the utter futility and thereby unwarranted physiologial, social, and psychological [destructiveness](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) of the mitigation measures governors around the United States and leaders around the world have implemented in the name of slowing the spread, measures for which there are no results to show. For over a year, political actors and public health officials have been proselytizing what now seems to be a permanently panicked citizenry into an unquestioned acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing guidelines despite more than a year's worth of data which have shown, and continue to show, zero correlation between the strength, timing, or duration of mitigation measures and incidence of COVID-19.



Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread
