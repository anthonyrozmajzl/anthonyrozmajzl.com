It isn't often we get to witness esteemed public health experts falter when the science behind lockdowns and mask mandates is called into question. The first memorable incident came a couple of months ago when White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt [fumbled](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) for an explanation during an MSNBC interview as to why Florida, a state that had been fully open since September, was seeing [lower hospitalizations per million](https://cdn.mises.org/roz1.png) and [lower age-adjusted deaths per million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExvLaPnWUAU14K-?format=jpg&name=large) than California, which has suffered one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the country. Not too long after this interview, in which Slavitt was reduced to empty platitudes about wearing masks and social distancing, the establishment's sainted health expert Dr. Anthony Facui recently [expressed](https://twitter.com/Izzy_B911/status/1381071918502141952?s=20) confusion during an MSNBC interview when remarking that he wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas is still experiencing falling cases and deaths one month after having lifted their statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions&mdash;remember, the effects of easing restrictions are supposed to be clearly visible after only two weeks. 

For over a year, political actors and public health officials have been proselytizing what now seems to be a permanently panicked citizenry into an unquestioned acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing guidelines, despite more than a year's worth of data which have shown, and continue to show, zero correlation between the strength, timing, or duration of mitigation measures and COVID-19 incidence.

- mortality table

- medical professionals directing economy, only qualified to quantify risk
-   unfortunately, the imperial college model which quantified the risk that led to lockdowns was horribly failed and off by an order of magnitude
-   CDC in charge of evictions??

- throwing out basic science: ideas like asymptomatic people can still be sick, lckdowns never recommended for even sever respiratory outbreaks prior to 2020
-   Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

MAIN

-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns
