It isn't often we get to witness esteemed public health experts falter when the science behind lockdowns and mask mandates are called into question. A couple of months ago White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt [fumbled](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) for an explanation during an MSNBC interview as to why Florida, a state that had been fully open since September, was seeing [lower hospitalizations per million](https://cdn.mises.org/roz1.png) and [lower age-adjusted deaths per million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExvLaPnWUAU14K-?format=jpg&name=large) than California, which has suffered one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the country. Not too long after this interview in which Slavitt was forced to fall back on empty platitudes about wearing masks and social distancing, the establishment's sainted health expert Dr. Anthony Facui [expressed](https://twitter.com/Izzy_B911/status/1381071918502141952?s=20) that he wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas is still experiencing falling cases and deaths one month after having lifted their statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions&mdash;remember, the effects of taking such neanderthal measures are supposed to be clearly visible after only two weeks. 

When two of the nation's leading COVID-19 figureheads cannot back up the supposed science behind lockdowns and mask mandates, that should raise some serious red flags. For over a year that the science was settled on lockdowns and mask mandates



Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns
