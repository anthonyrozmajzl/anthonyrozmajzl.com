A couple months ago White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt [fumbled](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) for an explanation during an MSNBC interview as to why Florida, a state that has been fully open since September, was seeing [lower hospitalizations per million](https://cdn.mises.org/roz1.png) and [lower age-adjusted deaths per million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExvLaPnWUAU14K-?format=jpg&name=large) than California, which has suffered one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the country. Not too long after Slavitt was forced to fall back on empty platitudes about wearing masks and social distancing, the establishment's sainted health exper Dr. Anthony Facui [expressed](https://twitter.com/Izzy_B911/status/1381071918502141952?s=20) confusion and mentioned that he wasn't "quite sure" why the neanderthal state of Texas saw their numbers continue to plummet after lifting their statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions. Like Slavitt, 



Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread
