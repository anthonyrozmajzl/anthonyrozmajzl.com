The media sure do have it easy. No matter how many failed predictions about new waves of Covid, variant spread, or superspreader events, the american people still listen and take their word as dogma, especially when it is deliviered by sainted figureheads such as Dr. Anthony Fauci. 

Fauci, "wait a few weeks" ..... "maybe it's because they're doing stuff outdoors" (https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1379402367683194880?s=20)....this is despite Fauci's previous warnings that Texas decision to lift remaining restrictions would be a disaster

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns
