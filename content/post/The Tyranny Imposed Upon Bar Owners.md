If the past year has reminded us of one thing, it is how quickly people are willing to trade basic freedoms for unprecedented levels of government overreach; but this hasn't been for no good reason. Government officials, in lockstep with big tech and the corporate press, promoted a culture of nearly unquestioned obedience, fueled by [mass hysteria](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1376/htm?fbclid=IwAR3hKqZ614zBr9zHXBOuaxTA8Z0Dt9Hb-TxObCY3qdpCJFuqh_Mmh3jCdtQ), by repeatedly berating the public with pithy slogans like "Wear a mask, slow the spread" and by framing the argument for various behavioral controls such as mask mandates, business closures, and travel restrictions as the morally upright stance that all good citizens must take in the name of preserving "public health"&mdash;national security officials utilize this same propagandistic tact by invoking "national security" to justify any intervention they see fit. Consequently, anyone questioning forced business closures, mask mandates, or other behavioral mandates on utlitarian or moral grounds are de facto enemies of public health, fully deserving of social ostracization and public scorn. 

Now, as we approach the one-year anniversary of "fifteen days to slow the spread,"he cult of unqeustioned obedience, owing their false sense of moral superiority to the earnest belief that they are "following the science," has effectively decentralized the government's role of enforcing covid-19 mandates. Private citizens have become emboldened by their establishment-backed narrative to publicly berate non-mask-wearers and rat out non-compiant businesses, treating the former as second-rate citizens and the latter as menaces to society. And nearly all private businesses, whether to appear selfless in the public eye, avoid shutdowns, or deter fines, require everyone to wear masks on their property. This type of societal behavior has an express purpose: punish those who refuse to comply with the edicts coming from our public health officials

Health officials are credentialed to quantify risk, but in no way does this make them qualified on what to do about that risk. Central planning fiasco, deadly costs of lockdowns

Years from now, populations around the world will recognize their governments' responses to the covid-19 pandemic as some of the greatest public health failures in human history. Not that this shouldn't have been expected; Not only was this one of the greatest failures from a public health standpoint, but just about every little freedom we once took for granted&mdash; going to work, running businesses, visiting family and friends, .....The speed with which politicians and public health experts subdued the social behaviors of states and countries around the world is astonishing. How quickly we went from fiteen days to slow the spread

Think back to our secssionist Unless you have been lucky enough to live in states like Florida and South Dakota Some, just about every of the most intimate and meaningful social This entire past year of failed public health policy was marked by hundreds of millions of people glued to their televisions and social media platforms simply to find out what their political superiors were going to allow them to do for the day.
