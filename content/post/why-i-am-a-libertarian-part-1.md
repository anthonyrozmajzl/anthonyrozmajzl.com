The principle reason I am a libertarian can be summed up with one of my all-time favorite quotations, taken from (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkein)[https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2964059-letters-of-j-r-r-tolkien]: "the most improper job of any man, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity."

This amazingly peaceful quotation stands side-by-side with the core of the libertarian movement, which is the Non-Aggression Pricniple
