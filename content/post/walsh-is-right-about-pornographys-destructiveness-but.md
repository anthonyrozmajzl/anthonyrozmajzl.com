- intro to the current debate and Walsh's twitter
- agree with walsh on seriousness of pornography and show extent of the epidemic
- mention how many of Walsh's critics would probably agree that pornography is very harmful, but they almost all disagree with his methods of bringing about change.
- talk about freedom of speech/bill of rights
    - reference my tweet about Walsh's definition of speech and how he thinks the content of a published video has any bearing on whether or not the video can be calssified as speech
    - See screenshot on phone: "If porn is 'speech' then a man masturbating in a public park is engaged in speech, and two people having sex on their front lawn in broad daylight is speech, and pretty much any act is speech, and the concept of free speech has no discernable meaning." In essence, Walsh's definition of speech only accomodates those things that are in accord with his set of acceptable moral practices. One could easily apply this logic to any perfectly normal, valid use of free speech...and because of the way Walsh chooses to phrase his ridiculous argument, you can argue for banning literally anything, like talking about monkeys: If talking about monkeys is 'speech' then a man talking about monkeys in a public park is engaged in speech, and two people dressed in moneky costumes on their front lawn in broad daylight is speech, and pretty much any act is speech, and the concept of free speech has no discernable meaning. So, if you happen to be offended by monkeys and those who dress like monkeys in public, Walsh has just provided you with an irrefutable basis for banning moneky speech and monkey costumes.
- reference other tweet in screenshots: "No the left won because conservatives gave u pon the culture and started accepting the left's most radical positions, such as the position that people have a sacred and inalienable right to make porn and publish it where kids can view it."
    - kids are not being forced to view it or having it foisted upon them, if that were the case, this tweet would be relevant
    - kids can also access graphic videos of abortions, they can access liquid detergent
    - Walsh consistently confuses the ability to access something with its being accessed
        - see screenshot of three tweets in one
- practical problems of banning porn
    - talk about prohibition (Walsh just calls these slogans in his article, doesn't deal with that perfectly valid argument)
    - talk about drug bans (record number of heroin deaths, massive addiction issues, etc.)
- free market response to the problem
    - Covenant eyes
    - prosecuting individuals where there are clear cases of people forcing children (or anyone) to watch pornography
            - Walsh wants to use the ridiculous example of adult couples having sex in public as an argument against the limits of free speech (this never happens)
    - allowing pornography produced legally at least gives a change of holding industries accountable to their practices, banning it and forcing it to the black market eliminates, if not severly reduces the level of accountability towards pornographer practices
    - it's all about parenting....restricting access and monitoring activity....today's technology makes it easier than ever to monitor browser activity
        - teach your children about the negative effects of pornorgraphy, monitor their access, be better parents
- talk about all the other things that seriosuly affect children in a negative way that Walsh would need to ban
    - bullies
    - alcohol (we know how that turned out with prohibition)
    - single motherhood (gonna go track down single)
    - neglectful parents
    - cigaretts
    - 
- closing: 
    - Even if pornography were able to be successfully outlawed banned, in order to ensure that people aren't accessing pornography on the black market, Walsh, who is clearly no longer a voice for limited government, must advocate 24/7 monitoring of everyone's browser history and throwing violators into cages.
        - mention recent screenshot in phone, third tweet: "Parents can't possibly protect their children from porn at this point. All it takes is one friend with a phone or a laptop. The situation is too out fo hand and porn is too ubiquitous. Either the state gets involved or we accept that kids will access this stuff. I don't accept it." Yes well nobody should accept the ridiculous false choice that either the state mandates certain behavior or kids will access porn. Why is there no mention of the church getting more involved, or parents getting more involved.
    - mention how conservatism has failed to conserve any meaningful ideology in the past 20 years...when they can't convince people to voluntarily change their behavior, they almost always turn to state mandates, i.e., violence....this is one surefire way to never change any hear ts or minds on the destructiveness of pornography, only will create resentment towards conservatices like Walsh
