In the past 72 hours, Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire has release two articles ([here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/walsh-i-said-porn-should-be-banned-and-lots-of-people-disagreed-heres-my-response-to-their-arguments) and [here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/walsh-a-group-of-republicans-want-the-government-to-start-fighting-hardcore-pornography-theyre-right-heres-why)) and a [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-386-its-time-for-a-war-on-porn/id1367210511?i=1000459114179) addressing crticisms to his advocacy for a ban on pornography. Walsh makes clear his stance on the matter:
> Hardcore internet porn is causing profound and measurable damage to entire generations of children. It also destroys families and harms society as a whole. It has no positive or neutral application. Its effect are deleterious and can only ever be deleterious. A person’s desire to post sex videos on the internet where children can view them does not and could not possibly outweigh society’s responsible to protect children and families from the damage done by the proliferation of such content. There is no inherent human right to make porn, so we must decide if the privilege to make porn is more important than a child’s need to be shielded from the foulest and darkest extremes of filth that now pervade the internet. In my view, it is not. And it’s not a close call.
