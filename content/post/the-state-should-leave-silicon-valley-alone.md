Isn't it amazing how productive and prosperous capitalism has made us? Never again will we have to work 12+ hours on a farm every day performing backbreaking labor just to achieve subsistence living standards. If you haven't noticed, life in the 21st century is a bit more comfortable. To get a sense for just how productive capitalism has made us, consider the fact that you can make a very comfortable living live-streaming yourself playing video games or posting makeup tutorials on YouTube. Or, get this: you can spend your entire career lobbying to break up the very organizations whose products and services have provided immeasurable value to nearly every inch of the globe.

This is the life of today's anti-trust politicians and lobbyists who have recently focused turned their gaze towards the tech giants of Silicon Valley in an effort to investigate potentially ["anti-competitive behavior"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html). Washington is taking a divide-and-conquer approach to the whole ordeal, opting for the Justice Department to administer investigations on Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission is slated to deal with Facebook and Amazon. 

You really have to marvel at the pompousness of the bureacurats in Washington. They are essentially declaring, on behalf of hundreds of millions of satisfied consumers, that companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple are too big and too dangerous for consumers, and therefore need to be broken up. Nevermind the fact that hundreds of millions of people are happily doing business with these companies on a daily basis. At the end of the day, Washington knows what's best for us, and it is our job to listen.

Not surprisingly, anti-big business sentiment permeates prominent businessmen as well. Christ Hughes, co-founder of Facebook, recently published an [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?module=inline) earlier in May calling for the company's breakup. I strongly encourage anyone to read the op-ed, but to do so carefully; it is riddled with anti-big-business platitudes, weak historical references, and makes little attempt at serious economic analysis.

To give you an example, Hughes attempts to argue for Facebook's breakup using a [brief historical quip](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?module=inline) to reveal that the anti-trust lawsuits that broke up Standard Oil in the early 1900s resulted in a doubling of its subsidiaries' profits within one year, and then a fivefold increase in profits only a few years later. This was all he had to say about Standard Oil, and from this breif remark you might think it sounds like a great idea, then, to break up Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. More profits for the little guy, right?

Now, it doesn't take a genius to intuit that breaking up Standard Oil would increase the profits of its subsidiaries. It's fairly obvious that the cheif organizational entity takes the lion's share of the revenue, and that breaking it up will return that revenue to its subsidiaries and raise their profits. What is more telling is that Hughes's remarks conveniently ignored the fact that it was *because* of Standard's large scale operations (they operated roughly 30 smaller divisions) that society was able to benefit so greatly in the first place! Hughes makes no attempt to recognize this fact.  

An [article](https://mises.org/library/truth-about-robber-barons) written by Thomas DiLorenzo paints the complete picture of Standrad Oil, demonstating that it was the very organizational structure and entrepreneurial ingenuity of Standard Oil that was responsible for drastcally cutting the price of oil refinement. Standard's efficiency cut consumer oil prices from 30 cents per gallon in 1860 to just 8 cents per gallon by 1885, a 73 percent reduction! The greatest irony of all is that by the time of the anti-trust lawsuits, Standard's market share had fallen by....this is due to competition forcing competitors to become more efficient...

breakup of standard benefited subsidiaries, but hurt the model that provided so much value to the consumer and the rest of society. We're supposed to believe that Standard Oil could *never* have gotten that big without destroying smaller businesses and squeezing every last drop out of consumers' wallets.This is the same fear we're expected to have for today's tech giants unless the government. 

Proper historical analysis flies directly in the face of those who cling to the same surface-level narrative espoused by Chris Hughes. Not only were his Standard Oil claims grossly inadequate and misleading, but he exhibited the power hungry, ivory tower opinions that plague

At the end of the day, the fact of the matter is that none of the Silicon Valley tech giants got to where they are by forcing people to buy their products and use their services. Hundreds of millions of people own iPhones, billions of people use Facebook, you probably purchase at least one thing a month from Amazon, and use Google on the regular.
