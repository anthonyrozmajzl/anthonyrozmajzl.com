- “Lockdowns save lives.”
    - Without any scientific or historical precedent vindicating the long-term cost-effectiveness of lockdowns, Covidians and their esteemed public health officials clamored to do something, anything to slow the spread. Legitimized by the public’s superstitious reverence for predictive models and the prophecies of public health experts, economies around the globe were shut down through legislative fiat. Governors around the United States confined citizens to their homes without a single vote, mandating unemployment and social isolation for millions. So much for our sacred democracy and the holy sacrament of voting.
    - At firstMaybe it isn’t so bad. This virus was scary to everyone and to a lot of people, including myself, staying at home and avoiding contact seemed like the right thing to do. Well, fifteen days had gone by, then another fifteen, then another fifteen, and then many more with no end in sight. It didn’t take long before the consequences of locking down started to reveal themselves, and it was clear that the lockdowns were destroying lives faster than they were supposedly saving them. Now more than ever, as countries head back into lockdown and the United States faces a looming Biden presidency, the Covidians must be made aware of the costs of lockdowns. What follows are some of the most alarming ways the lockdowns have killed and are continuing to kill people around the globe. Understanding these costs lays to rest the myth that lockdowns save lives.


- “Cases” are the most important metric
    - PCR testing
    - Any mention of cases without mentioning testing levels is tantamount to lying
        - You don’t have cases if people don’t get tested


- “Wear the damn mask”
    - This past Wednesday gov Mike DeWine implored his constituency to wear a mask so that others might live(https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20). He went on to tweet that mask wearing is “the chief way of slowing this virus.” (https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20). He quoted words attributed to Winston Churchill during WWII: “When you’re going through hell, keep going! He feigned the potential regret of having to shut down bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, etc., knowing full well that this would have no effect on his ability to put bread on his table and feed his family. DeWine’s entire Twitter feed from 11/10 is filled with statement after statement worthy of high priest in the Church of St. Fauci. Maybe these statements wouldn’t be so utterly embarrassing if the data showed any correlation between mask wearing and cases. I’m not even arguing that mask mandates should have produced massive drop in cases, but there should be at least even the tiniest indication that wearing masks reduces cases. Let’s observe a few areas around the world, courtesy of rationalground.com, to see just how effective mask wearing has been 


- They can’t stand the mention of Sweden
        - I recommend extreme caution when talking about Sweden. Noting the phenomenal success of Sweden’s “battle” with Covid-19 will likely invoke hissing more unbearable than a vampire being pressed with a silver crucifix in broad daylight. 
        - Most attempts at rebutting Sweden’s success start with mentioning Sweden’s high death rate. Yes, their death rate was high, but this was due to a poor management of nursing homes. Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren admitted (https://news.yahoo.com/sweden-admits-failure-protect-elderly-care-homes-024202762.html) that Sweden failed to protect their elderly. As of April 28, 90 percent of those who died from Covid-19 were over 70 years old. Half of these deaths occurred in nursing homes and another quarter occurred during at-home care

- Closing:
    - The vast majority of the population is now okay with sitting at home and watching TV to figure out what their governors and local officials are going to allow them to do for the day.
