# The Current Culture War

There is no denying that we are in the midst of an intense and passionately debated culture war. On one side of this debate are the Lockdowners who wish to continue with government mandated stay-at-home orders--some for a few months, others indefintely--until the number of COVID-19 cases/deaths falls below some arbitrarily determined threshold. The Lockdowners are satisfied with the pronouncements of government officials and health expert which have relegated us to a compelled indoor existence. "As long as other people are forced to stay inside," the Lockdowners say, "my safety is secured and more lives will be saved." For the Lockdowners it takes little more than a cursory glance at death projections and infection totals to justify their feeling of moral superiority in bringing millions of lives to a dangerous stand-still.

On the other side of this debate are those calling for a return to normalcy. These people have seen their most basic liberties eroded before their eyes; they've seen tens of millions of people abruptly barred from their jobs and removed from their ability to earn money to buy food, pay for utilities, and sustain themselves and the many million of lives who depend on them. They are driven by fear of seeing their businesses destroyed, businesses that represent their life's work, savings, and passions. They recognize that the economic pressures resulting from mass government-mandated unemployment and centralized distribution of medical resources stand to cause far more deaths than the Coronavirus itself. 

Our economy is not just an amalgam of haircuts, cheeseburgers, and booze. It is the result of brilliant entrepreneurial risk-taking, innovation, and the voluntary interactions of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their own dreams and passions. All of them depend on the economy's continued and unhindered operation to sustain themselves and their loved ones and achieve a life filled with meaning and purpose. A return to normalcy means that we can continue to work towards these things by exercising our fundamental right to self-determination, even if that means incurring some risk.

# The Data Won't Convince Them

In the fight for a return to normalcy, you can point to [articles](https://www.foxnews.com/media/california-doctor-questions-stay-at-home-orders) highlighting the importance of establishing herd immunity; to [warnings](http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/april/19/the-unseen-death-toll-of-covid-19-measures/) of the death and starvation that will come from destroying countless livelihoods and diverting medical resources away from patients with life-threatening illnesses; to [articles](https://fee.org/articles/sweden-s-top-epidemiologist-covid-19-infections-flattening-under-policy-of-individual-responsibility/) showing the success of the Swedish government's laissez-faire approach in trusting the rationality and responsibility of their people; to [pieces](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation) calling attention to the fact that we only really needed to seriously consider quarantining the elderly and those with underlying illness; to [graphs](https://twitter.com/WriterRomana/status/1255298101767737344?s=20) suggesting the inflation of death counts attributable to COVID-19; or to [articles](https://fee.org/articles/confronting-the-leviathan-of-the-covid-19-crisis/) decrying one the government's arrogation of unprecedented powers. 

While these findings suggest that the most rational approach is to call for an immediate end to the lockdowns, the only piece of data that seems relevant to the Lockdowners is the COVID-19 death toll.

# The Question No Lockdowner Can Answer

Although these arguments and all the questions they pose may fail to shift a Lockdowner's perspective, there is one important question to which they cannot give an answer: How high does a death projection need to be before you start implementing lockdown measures?

Many seem to forget that we have lived through a pandemic every bit as severe as the one we are living through today, but with no hint of a lockdown. This describes the year 1968, in which a deadly flu epidemic made its way across the United States, killing roughly [100,000](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html) Americans. 

Nobody was thrown in jail for surfing. No helicopters were [patrolling beaches](https://twitter.com/michaeljknowles/status/1257031573024567296) ordering people to stay off of them. No politicians were [encouraging snitching on those not following social distancing mandates](https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1251496378372632577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1251496378372632577&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fde-blasio-urges-new-yorkers-to-snitch-on-social-distance-rule-breakers%2F). All businesses stayed open. Quite frankly, life went on without a hitch. 

Jeffrey Tucker, editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research [highlights the fact](https://www.aier.org/article/woodstock-occurred-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/) that if we were able to extrapolate the 1968 flu death toll to today's much larger and generally unhealthier population, it is very likely that almost a quarter of a million people would have died.

Most crucially in his article, Tucker notes that 
> Stock markets didnâ€™t crash. Congress passed no legislation. The Federal Reserve did nothing. Not a single governor acted to enforce social distancing, curve flattening (even though hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized), or banning of crowds. No mothers were arrested for taking their kids to other homes. No surfers were arrested. No daycares were shut even though there were more infant deaths with this virus than the one we are experiencing now. There were no suicides, no unemployment, no drug overdoses. . .Media covered the pandemic but it never became a big issue.

By no metric was the flu epidemic any worse in 1968 than the Coronavirus epidemic of 2020. So if Lockdown Hysteria failed to rear its ugly head in 1968, what is different this time around? What suddenly makes the [72,000 projected deaths](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates) (as of 4/29/2020) the new standard by which governors can assume the authority to lock down their populations and force millions into unemployment? 

Consider also that during the 2017-2018 flu season there were an estimated [61,000 deaths and 800,000 hospitalizations](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018/archive.htm#table1), the equivalent of 15,250 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations every 3 months. Where was Lockdown Hysteria when these 15,250 lives were being lost? Where was the medical resource redistribution when we needed 67,000 hospital beds each month? Was this number just too small for the Lockdowners to care? 

Trying to understand the Lockdowners' death threshold becomes particularly difficult when we consider the most recent climate scare. As one recalls, the entirety of the Earth's 7.6 billion inhabitants was supposed to be wiped out in 12 years. If the equivalent of 162,500,000 deaths every 3 months wasn't enough to implement lockdown measures or travel bans to reduce our carbon footprint, there is really no discernible death threshold after which Lockdowners can justify the implementation of government-mandated lockdowns.

# The Burden Of Proof Is On The Lockdowners

Any mention of wanting to reopen the economy will earn you the label of a murderer by the Lockdowners. Every restaurant meal you eat, every movie you see, and every drink you have at a bar is one more COVID-19 death. Any effort to publicly protest one of the most egregious government power grabs of our time makes you a biological terrorist, at least according to screenwriter Mark Hughes.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are white nationalist terrorists, they are overtly intentionally trying to spread a disease in public &amp; threatening to shoot people. They should be treated exactly like any other terrorists who did this sort of deranged homicidal bullshit.</p>&mdash; Mark Hughes (@markhughesfilms) <a href="https://twitter.com/markhughesfilms/status/1255918186685321217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

No matter what label the Lockdowners ascribe to you, the fact of the matter is that the burden of proof is on them to tell you why things are different this time around, especially in light of the government's non-involvement in the equally deadly 1968 flu pandemic. No Lockdowner, apart from pure arbitration can tell you the number of projected deaths necessary to implement lockdown measures. And without a media-induced hysteria, I find it hard to believe that a vast majority of today's Lockdowners would even bat an eye at the death toll of COVID-19.
