A few years ago, the gender wage gap was a popular and often heated topic of discussion. On one side of the debate were those who believed that the gender wage gap was the result of an oppressive patriarchy. On the other side of the discussion were those who believed that different ambitions, personality traits, and voluntary decisions of men and women explained the gap. Back then, intellectuals on both sides made their case, often publicly, against those with whom they disagreed. Eventually, through rigorous discussions, lively debates, uncensored article posts, and [fiery interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54), the idea that women's earnings had anything to do with "the patriarchy" had been so thoroughly debunked that all discussion around it has ceased. 

Dismantling the approved Covid-19 narrative&mdash;mask mandates and lockdowns being effective virus mitigation strategies&mdash;appears to be a more formiddable challenge. Propagators of the approved Covid-19 narrative enjoy the benefits of censorship immunity and having their voices echoed across all major news outlets and social media platforms. They are shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies with neither scientific nor historical precedent. Those who see mask mandates and lockdowns as ineffective and, in the case of lockdowns, a disproportionately deadly strategy, do not enjoy these same benefits. These same people find themselves forced to wear masks primarily to avoid fines, public ridicule, or simply to placate the emotions of those who cannot stand the sight of a stranger's maskless face. This is thanks to the lack of intellectual debates and the shutting out of opinions dissenting from the approved narrative. The lack of serious discussion has allowed the media to thoroughly embedded in the minds of the American people the idea that the masked individual is the good and caring person, while the unmasked individual is the selfish, negligent, and punishable science-denier. This seemingly unalterable narrative rests, of course, on the critical assumption that mask mandates and lockdowns are effective tools for virus mitigation.

## Death By Data

The problem with accepting that the current Covid-19 narrative is unalterable is that there is far too much data to come to any other conclusion than mask mandates and lockdowns being incredibly ineffective virus mitigation strategies. A couple months ago, the author had [demonstrated](https://mises.org/wire/theres-still-no-evidence-either-lockdowns-or-masks-are-game-changers) the ineffectiveness of mask mandates and lockdowns using a plethora of data visualizations. Additionaly, you can read [30 studies](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/), including the recent [study](https://www.newsweek.com/covid-lockdowns-have-no-clear-benefit-vs-other-voluntary-measures-international-study-shows-1561656) published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation, all showing no clear benefit to state-imposed lockdowns as virus mitigation strategies. We also know of the disproportionately deadly [costs](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) associated with lockdowns and can point to numerous visualizations highlighting the utter futility of both mask mandates and lockdowns. 

But there is one visualization in particular, courtesy of [Hold2](https://twitter.com/Hold2llc), that lays the official Covid-19 narrative to rest. It compares hospitalizations and deaths in Flordia with those in New York and California, both highly touted examples of states that had "followed the science."

![FL vs Others](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUGfNRXIAEaTTl?format=jpg&name=large)

How is possible that Florida, a popular travel destination with one of the oldest populations in the country and fully open since September, currently has lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California, a state with heavy restrictions and one of the youngest populations in the country? The establishment-approved science simply cannot answer this question. Yes, overall California does slightly better than Florida in deaths per million, but this can be explained away largely in part by the vast age discrepancy which heavily favors youthful California. Florida has zero restrictions on bars, breweries, indoor dining, gyms, places of worship, gathering sizes, and almost all schools are offering in-person instruction. On the other hand, California and New York still retain [heavy restrictions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUGlYbXUAcyNrK?format=jpg&name=large) in all of these areas. At the *very* least, Florida's hospitalizations and deaths per million should be phenomenally worse than California's and New York's. Those who predicted death and destruction as a consequence of Flordia's September reopening simply cannot see these results as anything other than utterly remarkable. 

Invariably, this graph will invoke responses pointing to Californians' and New Yorkers' supposed lack of compliance. Relative to Florida, this claim is patently absurd on its face given the fact that Florida has been fully open since mid-September. Does anybody sincerely believe that Florida's numbers are lower because they're complying with mask mandates and social regulations better than California and New York? Certianly not. Floridians are consistently demonized as selfish, anti-science individuals who deserve every death coming their way. A quick glance at the reactions to a recent video](https://twitter.com/SamBrockNBC/status/1357047400548950023?s=20) of a maskless supermarket in Collier County, Florida should be enough to convince you of the general animosity held by most towards Floridians. 

More importantly, we can look at a few indicators that would tell us how heavily Floridians and Californians are complying with measures that supposedly help reduce covid-19 transmission. The following survey data is taken from Carnegie Mellon University's [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210201&region=FL). To the right of the red vertical line in each of the following graphs is roughly the time when Florida had consistently lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California. Beyond the red line is where we would definitely expect to see Floridians doing less of the things likely to contribute to the spread of covid-19.

#### Mask Compliance

#### Traveling

#### Restaurant Visits

![Restaurant Visits Fl vs CA](/images/RestaurantVisitsFLvsCA.png)

As you can see, the whole non-compliance schtick is nothing more than a convenient excuse to explain away undesirable trends. Californians, realtive to Floridians, have consistently been doing a much better job of avoiding social behaviors that allegedly fuel the spread of covid-19. Are we supposed to believe that prior to November 5, when California had *lower* hopitalizations and deaths per million than Florida, that Californians were doing a great job complying? Then, less than two months later, Californians unanimously stopped complying as they fell behind Florida in both metrics? This ridiculously dubious claim is at direct odds with the behavioral patterns shown above. 

Moving away briefly from the Flordia-California comparison, national metrics show that there still remains zero correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and deaths per million.

![50 States Restriction vs Deaths Per Million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqf4ZzjW4AAtgwQ?format=jpg&name=900x900)

In fact, if we visualize the trend in cases across all fifty states, each with varying levels of restrictions, you'll quickly notice a pattern that presents itself nearly identically across all fifty states: a bump in cases early in the year followed by a much bigger surge in cases during winter months. This pattern lends no support to the idea that governments can change the path of the virus. Rather, it appears that a simple changing of seasons is the key variable affecting case patterns.

Circling back to Collier County, FL, it would be suspected, according to the mainstream narrative, that this defiant county is raking in deaths faster than they can count them. Let's compare deaths in science-denying Collier County to science-following Imperial County, CA, which has had a mask mandate since April.

![Collier, FL vs Imperial County, CA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtWicZrVgAMRrTI?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

We can even take a look at counties within particular states&mdash;removing the climate/seasonality discrepancy&mdash;to see whether or not mask mandates have had any noticeable impact on cases. Let's look at Collier County, FL compared to its neighboring county of Charlotte, which has had a mask mandate since late July.

![Collier, FL vs Charlotte, FL](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtaYwP-UcAACDpW?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Here are few more county-level charts showing, yet again, that regardless of the timing or existence of mask mandates, similar regions follow the same case growth patterns.

Lastly, some of you may be wondering what happened to the "holiday surge" that was supposed to be ravaging our hospitals right about now. It never happened. Not only did the rate of covid-19 hospitalization growth *decline* after Thanksgiving, hospitalizations peaked less than two weeks after Christmas and have been sharply plummeting since!

As a bonus for those of you who like to keep up to date on the latest installments of The Media Who Cried Superspreader, Alabma came under heavy fire after [thousands of maskless football fans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tuscaloosa-celebration-alabama-national-championship-covid-19-concerns/) took to the streets to celebrate their team winning the national title. Fansided was [quick to label](https://fansided.com/2021/01/12/alabama-football-fans-defy-covid-guidelines-super-spreader-celebration-strip-videos/) the large celebration as a superspreader event. Health officials were [worried](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/health-officials-worry-alabama-football-celebration-was-superspreader-event.html) that the Alabama superspreader was going to result in a spike in cases. Here's what really happened.

![Alabama vs Missisippi Nat'l Championship](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etkd1TBVgAEuAor?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Miraculously, cases immediately plummeted after the superspreader event and continue to plummet to this day. What really complicates the superspreader narrative is that Mississippi, Alabama's next-door neighbor, followed a nearly identical case pattern despite hosting no superspreader events. Don't hold your breath expecting any sort of apology from the health officials and media outlets who predicted doom and gloom for Alabama.

## Conclusion

After nearly a year's worth of behavioral mandates, lockdowns, and business closures, there is still no data proving that mask mandates and lockdown are game-changing strategies for mitigating the spread of Covid-19. It is also abundantly clear that whether or not counties or states mandate masks at different times, for different periods of time, or mandate them at all has no bearing on the path of the virus. 

Daily Mail [reports](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9219379/Why-coronavirus-cases-falling-fast-New-infections-drop-44-three-weeks.html) that in the past few weeks, cases have fallen 45% in the United States, 30% globally, and hospitalizations have dropped 26% since their January 12 peak. Yet there appears to be a general confusion as to how this could even be happening. Are we going to hear that populations around the world have unanimously started complying, or that governments are finally cracking down and getting serious about enforcing their mandates? Possibly, but only as long as cases and hospitalizations continue to trend downwards. It is very unlikely, however, that health officials will start admitting that seasonality appears to be the most rational explanation for the year's worth of data showing nearly identical case trends across all fifty states despite a myriad of mitigations strategies.

Even if trends continue such that a return to normalcy seems more likely, it's not clear that everyone would prefer a return to normal life. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1357082538020339712?s=20) plans to ease current restrictions on gathering capacities. Responses to this's tweet&mdash;as with responses to similar tweets from other governors&mdash;indicate that many people still prefer to remain wrapped up in their safety blanket of social regulations. This is a significant challenge to overcome, but with the amount of data that brings the mainstream covid-19 narrative to its knees, this challenge is not insurmountable.
