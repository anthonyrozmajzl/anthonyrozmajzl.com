# Big Picture Covid-19 Data That Puts All The Hysteria Into Perspective

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Ben Shapiro, but feelings trump facts when it comes to covid-19. This is thanks entirely to the love triangle forged between the corporate press, the state, and tech giants whose sinister campaign of fear and censorship spawned a reaction so virulent that society was upended in a matter of weeks for a virus with a [99.5% survival rate](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21260210v1.full.pdf+html) for those under 70.

In no time whatsoever sacrificing for and preserving “public health”&mdash;costs be damned&mdash;became the chief end of mankind. Relegating oneself to a life of submission to state-imposed lockdowns and mask mandates became the greatest calling one could fulfill (at least until the vaccine arrived). In these past 18 months have any governors, presidents, or prime ministers ever suggested that maybe the people ought to have a vote&mdash;as is, ostensibly, their sacred right under a democracy&mdash;to determine whether or not every aspect of their social life be subject to manipulation on a daily basis? Of course not. In times of state-declared emergencies, when people’s most fundamental human rights are on the line, we quickly find that our "sacred right to vote" and "the will of the people" were never anything more than convenient little tropes we learned in our third-grade social studies class. It appears that our only job in times of emergency is to wait on marching orders from the ruling elite.

What many should have come to realize over this past year and a half are two lamentable traits of the average person: (1) The trained instinct&mdash;learned primarily in government schools&mdash;to revere and please to those in positions of government authority and (2) the desire for safety over liberty. Fused with modernity's cushy standards of living, these two traits have enabled a series of effortless goalpost shifts, all the way from “15 days to flatten the curve" to "You'll be needing semi-annual booster shots to renew your vaccine passport in order to participate in normal human life." Of course, every goalpost shift was instinctively accepted as nothing more than our altruistic rulers working to keep us safe.

Those who have no issue with an ever-tightening security blanket of social regulations have yet to familiarize themselves the big-picture covid data which continue to put all of this hysteria into perspective, particularly the data which show zero meaningful correlation between government interventions and health outcomes. A proper understanding of this data leads to the realization that this virus is not your fault or anybody else's.


Lockdowns:

*There is zero meaningful correlation between lockdown strength and covid-19 outcomes*. The lockdowns were a novel public health experiment that, prior to 2020, had [never been recommended](https://www.hartgroup.org/covid-19-evidence/) even for *severe* respiratory outbreaks. But with a little bit of media-induced panic, the face-saving desire to act in accord with other nations, and a theistic reverence for the wildly inaccurate [Imperial College London model](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/), it was simply accepted that lockdowns saved lives. Consequently, many simply accepted that stronger lockdowns would be more effective than weaker ones. 

All costs and moral arguments aside, heavy skepticism towards lockdowns was justfied as early as April, 2020 when it was [shown](https://www.aier.org/article/did-the-lockdown-save-lives/) that a region's time to lockdown was a non-factor in mitigating the spread of covid-19. Fast forward 11 months and we find that data from March 1, 2020 - March 1, 2021 (this date range is meant to exclude any significant vaccine uptake&mdash;at this point the United States was on top with only [7.6%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) of its population fully vaccinated while all other nations hovered [between 1 and 4%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)) show that lockdowns were always a non-factor in mitigating the spread of covid-19. The following data is for the 55 nations with highest GDP.

We can draw the same conclusion about lockdowns in the United States.




*The vast majority of deaths occur in the elderly and those with underlying health problems

Masks:

*There is no evidence suggesting that either mask mandates or increased mask usage reduces COVID-19 incidence*

*WHO has not found any (RCTs) that suggest our cloth masks and blue surgical masks mitigate the spread of covid 19*

*Increased mask usage has zero impact on covid-19 outcomes* (explore US, compare countries, compare states)

*There is no serious evidence to suggest that children should be wearing masks in schools* Thread of mask vs non-mask schools. Flu is and swine flu was deadlier to kids yet nobody called for mask mandates in schools prior to 2020. 

Vaccines: 

*There is no meaningful correlation between vaccine uptake and case growth* Fauci: "With 50% vaccinated I feel fairly certain you're not going to see the kind of surges we've seen in the past"

*Incredibly

*In other words if you feel sick, stay home; if you don't feel sick, live your life.* - Fauci quote about asympt spread: “The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person,” Fauci said at the Jan. 28 White House press briefing. “Even if there's a rare asymptomatic person that might transmit, an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers."
