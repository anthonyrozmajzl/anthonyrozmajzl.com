# Big Picture Covid-19 Data That Puts All The Hysteria Into Perspective

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Ben Shapiro, but the past 18 months have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that feelings trump facts when it comes to covid-19. This is thanks entirely to the love triangle forged between the corporate press, state officials, and tech giants whose sinister campaign of fear and censorship spawned a reaction so virulent that society was upended in a matter of weeks for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate. (Get source on official survival rate)

In response to the famous imperative, “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country,” millions found, perhaps for the first time in their lives, a cause greater than themselves through which they found meaning: “For my fellow man I will stay home; I will obey the doctors and government officials that appear on my TV; I will adorn my face mask at all times to protect others; I will continue to adorn my face mask when nobody is near me, lest I am labeled an enemy of the noble mission bestowed upon me by the state; I will inoculate myself for the good of humanity because I truly care about human life. Through these I become a better citizen, I become a better person, and I am safe.”

In no time whatsoever, sacrificing for and preserving “public health”—costs be damned—became the chief end of mankind. Relegating oneself to a life of submission to state-imposed lockdowns and mask mandates became the greatest and most charitable calling one could fulfill (at least until the vaccine arrived). Did any Governor or president ever suggest that maybe the people ought to have a vote—as is, ostensibly, their sacred right under a democracy—to determine whether or not every aspect of their social life be subject to manipulation on a daily basis? Of course not. In times of state-declared emergencies, when people’s most fundamental human rights are on the line, we quickly find that “our democracy” and “our sacred right to vote” were never anything more than convenient little tropes we learned in our third-grade social studies class. What has this past year and a half entailed other than each of us sitting around just hoping that some politican or bureaucrat drums up a public health policy that you happen to approve of? It takes an incredible amount of naivety, especially with history as our guide, to believe that emergency societal overhauls have more to do with our safety than with the state’s natural inclination toward increased power.

What many should have come to realize these past 18 months are two lamentable traits of the average person: (1) The trained instinct—learned primarily in government schools—to revere and defer to those in positions of government authority and (2) the desire for safety over liberty. These traits have enabled a series of effortless goalpost shifts: from “It’s only two weeks” to “It’s just until hospitalizations are down” to “It’s just until cases are down” to “Its just proof of a negative test” to “It’s just until the vaccine arrives” to “It’s just until a certain percentage of the population is vaccinated” to “Your vaccination papers, please.” Each power grab was instinctively accepted as nothing more than our noble authorities working to ensure our safety.

Simply put, those who happily anticipate an ever-tightening, more “protective” security blanket of social regulations have yet to understand the big picture covid data which put this past year and a half into perspective, particularly data which show zero meaningful correlation between government intervention and health outcomes. Here is what the big picture data tell us.

Lockdowns:

*There is zero meaningful correlation between lockdown strength and covid-19 outcomes*. Heavy skepticism toward lockdown efficacy was justfied as early as April, 2020 when it was [shown](https://www.aier.org/article/did-the-lockdown-save-lives/) that a region's time to lockdown was a non-factor in mitigating the spread of covid-19. From March 1, 2020 - March 1, 2021 (this date range is meant to exclude any significant vaccine uptake&mdash;at this point the United States was on top with only [7.6%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) of its population fully vaccinated while all other nations hovered [between 1 and 4%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)) the data unequivocally show no correlation between lockdown strength and covid-19 outcomes. 

Masks:

*Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide almost no justification for masks*

*Increased mask usage has zero impact on covid-19 outcomes* (explore US, compare countries, compare states)

*If you're asymptomatic and healthy, continue living life as normal

Vaccines: 

*There is no meaningful correlation between vaccine uptake and case growth* Fauci: "With 50% vaccinated I feel fairly certain you're not going to see the kind of surges we've seen in the past"

*Incredibly
