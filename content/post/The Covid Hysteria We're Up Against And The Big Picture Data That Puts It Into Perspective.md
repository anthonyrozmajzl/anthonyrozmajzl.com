# Big Picture Covid-19 Data That Puts All The Hysteria Into Perspective

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Ben Shapiro, but the past 18 months have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that feelings trump facts when it comes to covid-19. This is thanks entirely to the love triangle forged between the corporate press, state officials, and tech giants whose sinister campaign of fear and censorship spawned a reaction so virulent that society was upended in a matter of weeks for a virus with a 99% survival rate. (Get source on official survival rate)

In response to the famous imperative, “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country,” millions found, perhaps for the first time in their lives, a cause greater than themselves through which they achieved a sense of purpose: “For my fellow man I will remain in total isolation; I will obey the doctors and government officials on my TV; I will wear my face mask at all times for others' safety as well as my own; I will continue to wear my face mask when nobody is near me, lest I am labeled an enemy of the noble mission bestowed upon society by the state; I will inoculate myself for the good of humanity because I truly care about human life. Through these I become a better citizen, I become a better person, and I am safe.”

In no time whatsoever sacrificing for and preserving “public health”—costs be damned—became the chief end of mankind. Relegating oneself to a life of submission to state-imposed lockdowns and mask mandates became the greatest and most charitable calling one could fulfill (at least until the vaccine arrived). Did any Governor or president ever suggest that maybe the people ought to have a vote—as is, ostensibly, their sacred right under a democracy—to determine whether or not every aspect of their social life be subject to manipulation on a daily basis? Of course not. In times of state-declared emergencies, when people’s most fundamental human rights are on the line, we quickly find that “our democracy” and “our sacred right to vote” were never anything more than convenient little tropes we learned in our third-grade social studies class. If that seems nonsensical to you, simply ask yourself what this past year and a half has entailed other than each of us sitting around just hoping that some politican or bureaucrat drums up a public health measure that you happen to agree with? 

What many should have come to realize these past 18 months are two lamentable traits of the average person: (1) The trained instinct—learned primarily in government schools—to revere and defer to those in positions of government authority and (2) the desire for safety over liberty. These traits have enabled a series of effortless goalpost shifts: from “It’s only two weeks” to “It’s just until hospitalizations are down” to “It’s just until cases are down” to “Its just proof of a negative test” to “It’s just until the vaccine arrives” to “It’s just until a certain percentage of the population is vaccinated” to “Your vaccination papers, please.” Each power grab was instinctively accepted as nothing more than our noble authorities working to ensure our safety.

Those who happily anticipate an ever-tightening security blanket of social regulations would do well to familiarize themselves with the big-picture covid data which put all this hysteria into perspective, particularly the data which show zero meaningful correlation between government intervention and health outcomes. 

## The Virus Isn't Your Fault, And Here's The Data to Show It

Lockdowns:

*There is zero meaningful correlation between lockdown strength and covid-19 outcomes*. The lockdowns were a novel public health experiment. Prior to 2020, the World Health Organization had advised against lockdowns even for *severe* respiratory outbreaks. Heavy skepticism toward lockdown efficacy was justfied as early as April, 2020 when it was [shown](https://www.aier.org/article/did-the-lockdown-save-lives/) that a region's time to lockdown was a non-factor in mitigating the spread of covid-19. From March 1, 2020 - March 1, 2021 (this date range is meant to exclude any significant vaccine uptake&mdash;at this point the United States was on top with only [7.6%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) of its population fully vaccinated while all other nations hovered [between 1 and 4%](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)) the data show no correlation between lockdown strength and covid-19 outcomes. 


*The vast majority of deaths occur in the elderly and those with underlying health problems

Masks:

*WHO has not found any (RCTs) that suggest our cloth masks and blue surgical masks mitigate the spread of covid 19*

*Increased mask usage has zero impact on covid-19 outcomes* (explore US, compare countries, compare states)

*There is no serious evidence to suggest that children should be wearing masks in schools* Thread of mask vs non-mask schools. Flu is and swine flu was deadlier to kids yet nobody called for mask mandates in schools prior to 2020. 

Vaccines: 

*There is no meaningful correlation between vaccine uptake and case growth* Fauci: "With 50% vaccinated I feel fairly certain you're not going to see the kind of surges we've seen in the past"

*Incredibly

*In other words if you feel sick, stay home; if you don't feel sick, live your life.* - Fauci quote about asympt spread: “The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person,” Fauci said at the Jan. 28 White House press briefing. “Even if there's a rare asymptomatic person that might transmit, an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers."

Study metanalysis home mask spread shows .7% of cases are the result of asymptomatic transmission

Rebut the following: Results  The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may ac (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707)
