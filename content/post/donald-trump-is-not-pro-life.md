Pro life leader Abby Johnson has been defending herself quite a bit on Twitter over her future decision to vote for Donald Trump, primarily stemming from her choice to vote for the pro-life candidate and stick to her convictions (find tweet). Are her convictions about Trump’s being pro-life well founded? Absolutely not.


To be fair, Trump has unashamedly denounced Planned Parenthood and has consistently held a solid pro-life stance when it comes to unborn children. But that’s just it, he is exceptionally pro-life only when it comes to the lives of unborn children. When it comes to the lives of innocent Middle Eastern fathers, wives, sons, and daughters, Trump’s foreign policy record washes him clean of any credibility with the pro-life movement.


The pro-life ideology extends far beyond the lives of unborn children; it applies to the sick and elderly, teenagers, adults, and those from different cultures and countries than our own. It is this last demographic where many pro-life, pro-Trump Christians seem to forget the pro-life message, or intentionally toss it out altogether. They conveniently forget that Trump has inherited, and proudly upheld, the establishment’s commitment to meddle in the affairs of other nations, waging war and inflicting death on countless innocent lives. For a full treatment on this claim, please read Scott Horton’s Fool’s Errand for a masterful account of the absolute criminality and failure of our 19-year campaign in the Middle East, as well as our aggressive interventions that inflamed tensions in the region prior to 9/11. 


Simply put, Trump has displaced and enabled the literal dismemberment of thousands of innocent  lives. If you recognize this and continue to laud Trump as some sort of pro-life icon, or shirk this reality to the side, then you either hold, or choose to hold, an extremely perverted understanding of what it means to be pro-life.


Specifics of interventions.


When Abby Johnson says she’s voting for Trump because of her pro-life convictions, she’s either unaware of the death he has fostered in the Middle East or is intentionally casting aside the fullness of the pro-life message. 


If Abby Johnson considers herself to be truly pro-life, Jacob Hornberger...maybe mention how tulsi gabbard is opposite of Trump on pro life
