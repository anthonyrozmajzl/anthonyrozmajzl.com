South Korea, which has (been dealing with COVID-19 cases)[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095848/south-korea-confirmed-and-suspected-coronavirus-cases/] since January 20, offers statistics that should stifle the panic that has run rampant across the United States and prompted the institution of draconian measures never before seen during peacetime. 

Because South Korea has been dealing with COVID-19 cases since January 20, they offer a more complete picture of how the virus affects different age demographics. Take a look at their (case distribtuion by age group and gender)[https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030] as of March 20, 2020 :

Two things should immediately stand out as striking: First, over 92% of fatalities can be attributed to those older than 60. This is not terribly far removed from (Italy's statistics)[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103023/coronavirus-cases-distribution-by-age-group-italy/], which show that 74% of fatalities can be attributed to those 50 years or older. Second, even though those younger than 50 comprise almost 60% of reported South Korean cases, this demographic collectively represents only 2.12% of fatalities.
