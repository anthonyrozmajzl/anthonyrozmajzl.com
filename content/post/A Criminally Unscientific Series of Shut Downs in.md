This narrative has become so thoroughly embedded in our culture that it is now widely accepted that any individual or business that questions or defies forced business closures, mask mandates, gathering restrictions, or other behavioral mandates is de facto an enemy of public health, a science-denier fully deserving of legal punishment and public scorn.

As a result, many individuals and private businesses, whether to avoid shutdowns, heated public confrontations, or deter fines, are forced to reluctantly fall in line with government mandates.
