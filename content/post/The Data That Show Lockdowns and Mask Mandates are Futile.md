# The Data Show That Lockdowns and Mask Mandates are Futile

Data visualization is a wonderful thing. It helps us understand important trends that would otherwise be invisible in raw data alone. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in rebutting some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert&mdash;by force if necessary&mdash;their secular brothers and sisters who are lost in delusional pseudoscience. Members who question the effectiveness of lockdowns and mask mandates face immediate excommunication. "Lockdowns save lives!", "Wear the damn mask!", and "Do what you're told", to name a few, have become cornerstone dogmata of this contemporary church. But what can simple data analysis tell us about these first two teachings? Let's have a look.

## “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors single-handedly began shutting down their economies in an effort to quickly do something, *anything* to slow the spread. Unemployment and social isolation were mandated for millions without a single vote&mdash;go, democracy! Questioning these orders was tantamount to questioning the Science<sup>TM</sup>, a grave Covidian sin that relegated one to the lowly status of haircut-loving grandma killer. However, after only a few months of lockdown, it became apparent that there was no correlation between how soon a region locked down and its death toll:

Locking down quickly clearly did not matter, and this is something we knew as early as April. But what about locking down in general? Surely the strictest lockdowns are saving the most lives today, right? Hardly.

If Covidian lockdown dogma were true, this plot would unambiguosuly slope downwards, indicating that more stringent lockdowns are more effective at preventing cases. No such trend exists, and to point out the obvious lack of correlation in either of the above charts will have you anathematized by the Church of St. Fauci. "They didn't have a *real* lockdown!" the Covidians will yell. Sound familiar? 

### The costs of locking down

Not only have the lockdowns played no role in disease mitigation, recent data show that the costs of locking down *far* outweigh the perceived benefits. You would think that the pro-lockdown Scientists<sup>TM</sup> informing public health decisions would have examined the costs of disrupting global supply chains and forcing hundreds of millions of people to remained shuttered in their homes. But no matter. When nations around the globe are at "war" with a virus, immediate action is the only option. Damn the consequences. 

What follow are some of the most alarming costs associated with the lockdowns, costs the Covidians are likely to have neither hear of nor considered. These costs are brutal, depressing, and lay to rest the myth that lockdowns save lives.

- The New York Times [predicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html) 1.4 million excess tuberculosis deaths alongside nearly 1 million excess malaria and HIV deaths
- The UN [estimates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger/2020/07/13/0733e34e-c51e-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html) that as many as 130 million people will be at risk of starvation thanks to the lockdown's disruption of global food supply chains
- The CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm) just under 200,000 excess deaths, a [26.5% jump](https://www.dailywire.com/news/new-cdc-numbers-show-lockdowns-deadly-toll-on-young-people) from previous years, attributable to Covid-19 over a 10 month period; a majority of these deaths affected 25-44 year olds
- UNICEF [predicted](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid-19-devastates-already-fragile-health-systems-over-6000-additional-children) an excess of 1.2 million child deaths (ages 5 and under) over a six month period
- The Associate Press [linked](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd) virus-related hunger to 10,000 child deaths per month for the first year of the pandemic
- The CDC [conducted a week long survey in June](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/08/18/the-pandemic-has-caused-an-increase-in-anxiety-stress-depression-and-suicides/?sh=23f44a175863) finding that 25% of young adults between 18-24 years of age have considered suicide because of the pandemic.
- CBS [cited](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-deaths-suicides-drugs-alcohol-pandemic-75000/) a study indicating the potential for 75,000 excess deaths of despair: deaths due to drug and alcohol abuse or suicide
- A CDC report [found](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525797-cdc-pediatric-visits-to-emergency-rooms-for-mental-health-problems?amp&__twitter_impression=true) a 31% increase in mental health-related emergency room visits for children between the ages of 12 and 17 over a three month period.

Quite clearly the lockdowns are doing more harm than good. Even the Atlantic [admitted](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/coronavirus-pandemic-developing-world/614578/) that asking people in low to middle-income countries to stay home is, in many cases, asking them to starve. To point out these grim realities, however, is blaspheming the Science<sup>TM</sup> and, by extension, his holiness Dr. Anthony Fauci!

## “Wear the damn mask.”

This past Wednesday governor Mike DeWine of Ohio went on a fairly lengthy Twitter tirade about the importance of wearing masks. Among many things he [implored](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20) his constituency to wear masks so that their friends, family, and neighbors may live. Most foolishly he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20) that we now know "mask wearing . . . is the chief way of slowing this virus.” These statements give the impression that wearing masks slows the spread of Covid-19. It would be wonderful if we could all wear masks for a month and beat this thing, but the data consistently reiterate the futility of mask mandates. Let’s observe some different areas around the world to see just how effective mask wearing has been in slowing the spread:

Even in the face of these charts&mdash;more of which can be found [here](https://rationalground.com/mask-charts/), [here](https://rationalground.com/more-mask-charts/), [here](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/matt-margolis/2020/10/06/do-masks-really-work-heres-what-the-charts-tell-us-n1009481), and [here](https://twitter.com/ianmSC/media)&mdash; which fail to show even a slight drop in cases post mask mandate, we are told to keep trusting the Science<sup>TM</sup>, wear the damn mask, and now to simply ["Do what you're told."](https://twitter.com/deaceproducer/status/1327256913248198661?s=21)

## A brief note on "cases"

This has undoubtedly been a case-driven pandemic. Lockdowns, public health mandates, and societal panic ebb and flow alongside case count. Much, if not all of this panic can be attributed to extremely sensitive PCR tests, which are used to confirm Covid-19 "cases." The quotations around "cases" are warranted given that the vast majority of positive PCR tests [detect inert genetic material](https://redstate.com/michael_thau/2020/09/03/ny-times-up-to-90-whove-tested-covid-positive-wrongly-diagnosed-truth-a-whole-lot-worse-pt-2-n253328), that is, "dead" chunks of virus that pose no threat to anybody. A fairly recent New York Times piece sums up the issue nicely.

>Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles. With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30. In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles. . .

In this same [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html) Juliet Morrison, virologist at the the University of California, said anything over 35 cycles is too sensitive. Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina recommended a cycle threshold of 30 or less.

Ultra sensitive PCR testing leads to an artificially high case count, which translates into an artifically high number of Covid-19 hospitalizations. Even in the face of all this, United States hospitalization utilization rates [remain under 80 percent](https://twitter.com/SWAtlasHoover/status/1327828349641773058?s=20) in all areas except Rhode Island and Washington, D.C. In some regions, this represents an improvement over the same time period in previous years. Simply lowering the sensitivity of PCR tests to realistic levels would end this fiasco very quickly.

## Returning to normal life

We are long overdue for a return to normal life, not some dystopian, Covidian "new normal" where strangers are faceless pathogens, gatherings are limited to 20 people, and the elderly are expected to die alone in nursing homes. Normal lives include things that give it meaning, like musicals, concerts, professional sporting events, large family gatherings and celebrations, traveling the world, going to comedy shows, and so much more. All these things technically still exist, but only as shadows in Plato's cave.
