# The Data That Show Lockdowns and Mask Mandates are Futile

Data visualization is a wonderful thing. It helps us understand important trends that would otherwise be invisible in raw data alone. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in rebutting some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert&mdash;by force if necessary&mdash;their wordly brothers and sisters who are lost in their delusional pseudoscience. Members who question the effectiveness of lockdowns, mask mandates, or even suggest that Sweden's approach was successful face immediate excommunication. The Church of Saint Fauci's teachings are infallible&mdash;"Lockdowns save lives!", "Wear the damn mask!", and "Do what you're told", to name a few, have become cornerstone teachings of this contemporary church. But what can simple data analysis tell us about these first two cherished dogmata? Let's have a look.

## “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors single-handedly began shutting down their economies and mandating mask wearing in an effort to quickly do something, *anything* to slow the spread. Unemployment and social isolation were mandated for millions without a single vote&mdash;go, democracy! Questioning these orders was tantamount to questioning the Science<sup>TM</sup>, a grave Covidian sin that relegated one to the lowly status of haircut-loving grandma killer. However, after only a few months of lockdown, it became apparent that there was no correlation between how soon a region locked down and their death toll:

Locking down quickly clearly did not matter, and we knew this back in April. But what about locking down in general? Surely the strictest lockdowns are saving the most lives today, right? Hardly.

If Covidian lockdown dogma were true, this plot would unambiguosuly slope downwards, indicating that the more stringent lockdowns are more effective at preventing cases. No such trend exists, and to point out the obvious lack of correlation in either of the above charts will have you anathematized by the Church of St. Fauci. "They didn't have a *real* lockdown!" they'll yell. Sound familiar?

### The costs of locking down

Not only have the lockdowns played no role in disease mitigation, recent data show that the costs of locking down *far* outweigh the perceived benefits. You would think that the pro-lockdown Scientists<sup>TM</sup> informing public health decisions would have examined the costs of disrupting global supply chains and forcing hundreds of millions of people to remained shuttered in their homes. But no matter. When nations around the globe are at "war" with a virus, immediate action is the only option. Damn the consequences. 

What follows are some of the most alarming costs associated with the lockdowns, costs the Covidians are likely to have never heard. These costs are brutal, depressing, and lay to rest the myth that lockdowns save lives.

- The New York Times [predicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html) 1.4 million excess tuberculosis deaths alongside nearly 1 million excess malaria and HIV deaths
- The UN [estimates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger/2020/07/13/0733e34e-c51e-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html) that as many as 130 million people will be at risk of starvation thanks to the lockdown's disruption of global food supply chains
- The CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm) just under 200,000 excess deaths, a [26.5% jump](https://www.dailywire.com/news/new-cdc-numbers-show-lockdowns-deadly-toll-on-young-people) from previous years, attributable to Covid-19; a majority of these deaths affecting 25-44 year olds
- UNICEF [predicted](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid-19-devastates-already-fragile-health-systems-over-6000-additional-children) an excess of 1.2 million child death (ages 5 and under) over a six month period
- The Associate Press [linked](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd) virus-related hunger to 10,000 child deaths per month
- The CDC [conducted a week long survey in June](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/08/18/the-pandemic-has-caused-an-increase-in-anxiety-stress-depression-and-suicides/?sh=23f44a175863) finding that 25% of young adults between 18-24 years of age have considered suicide because of the pandemic.
- CBS [cited](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-deaths-suicides-drugs-alcohol-pandemic-75000/) a study indicating the potential for 75,000 excess deaths of despair: deaths due to drug and alcohol abuse or suicide
- A CDC report [found](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525797-cdc-pediatric-visits-to-emergency-rooms-for-mental-health-problems?amp&__twitter_impression=true) a 31% increase in mental health-related emergency room visits for children between the ages of 12 and 17 over a three month period.

Quite clearly the lockdowns are doing far more harm than good. Even the Atlantic [admitted](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/coronavirus-pandemic-developing-world/614578/) that asking people in low to middle-income countries to stay home is, in many cases, asking them to starve. To point out these grim realities, however, is blaspheming the Science<sup>TM</sup> and, by extension, his holiness Dr. Anthony Fauci! To defy or even question lockdown orders is tantamount to murder in the eyes of the Covidians.

## “Wear the damn mask.”

This past Wednesday governor Mike DeWine of Ohio went on a fairly lengthy Twitter tirade about the importance of wearing masks. Among many things he [implored](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20) his constituency to wear masks so that their friends, family, and neighbors may live. Under false pretense he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20) that we now know "mask wearing . . . is the chief way of slowing this virus.” These statements give the impression that wearing masks slows the spread of Covid-19. While it would not be fair to require a massive drop in cases to vindicate mask mandates, there should be at leaset *some* distinguishable drop in cases. It would be wonderful if we could all wear masks for a month and beat this thing, but the data consistently reiterate the futility of mask mandates. Let’s observe some different areas around the world to see just how effective mask wearing has been in slowing the spread:

![Argentina Mask Chart](https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-14-Argentina-Cases-2048x1503.png)

Even in the face of these charts&mdash;more of which can be found [here](https://rationalground.com/mask-charts/), [here](https://rationalground.com/more-mask-charts/), [here](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/matt-margolis/2020/10/06/do-masks-really-work-heres-what-the-charts-tell-us-n1009481), and [here](https://twitter.com/ianmSC/media)&mdash; we are told to keep trusting the Science<sup>TM</sup>, wear the damn mask, and ["Do what you're told."](https://twitter.com/deaceproducer/status/1327256913248198661?s=21). 

This has undoubtedly been a case-driven pandemic. Lockdown and mask mandate intesnsity ebbs and flows with case count. Ironically, all government authorities would have to do to convince people that mask wearing and lockdowns are effective is lower the cycle threshold of extremely sensitive PCR testing, which is used to confirm Covid-19 "cases". Unfortunately, current PCR testing is so sensitive that a vast majority of positive cases are [detecting inert genetic material](https://redstate.com/michael_thau/2020/09/03/ny-times-up-to-90-whove-tested-covid-positive-wrongly-diagnosed-truth-a-whole-lot-worse-pt-2-n253328), that is, "dead" chunks of virus that pose no threat to anybody. Simply lowering the sensitivity of PCR tests to realistic levels would end this fiasco within a month. But you can be sure that the state would give the credit to the mask mandates and lockdowns.

### Returning to normal life

With all the damage incurred by the Church of Saint Fauci's dogmata around the world, civil disobedience is a good first step in achieivng a return to normal life, a life worth living, not some distopyian "new normal" where strangers are faceless pathogens, gatherings are limited to 20 people, and the elderly are expected to die alone in nursing homes. A life worth living is one with musicals, concerts, professional sporting events, large family gatherings and celebrations, traveling the world, going to comedy shows, and so much more. While these things technically still exist, they exist only as shadows in Plato's cave.
