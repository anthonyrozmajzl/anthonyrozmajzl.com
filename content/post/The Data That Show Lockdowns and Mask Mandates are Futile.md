Data visualization is a wonderful thing. It helps us understand important trends that would otherwise be invisible in raw data alone. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in rebutting some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert&mdash;by force if necessary&mdash;their secular brothers and sisters who are lost in delusional pseudoscience. Members who question the effectiveness of lockdowns and mask mandates face immediate excommunication. "Lockdowns save lives!", "Wear the damn mask!", and "Do what you're told", to name a few, have become cornerstone dogmata of this contemporary church. But what can simple data analysis tell us about these first two teachings? Let's have a look.

## “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors single-handedly began shutting down their economies in an effort to quickly do something, *anything* to slow the spread. Questioning these orders was tantamount to questioning the Science<sup>TM</sup>, a grave Covidian sin that relegated one to the lowly status of haircut-loving grandma killer. However, after only a few months of lockdown, it became apparent that there was no correlation between how soon a region locked down and its death toll:

![Days to Lockdown](https://www.aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ED-AZ636_Rodger_16U_20200426130615-1-1.jpg)

The abysmally low R<sup>2</sup> value shows that locking down quickly clearly did not matter, but what about locking down in general? Surely the strictest lockdowns would save more lives, right? Hardly.

If Covidian lockdown dogma were true, this plot would unambiguously slope downwards, indicating that more stringent lockdowns are more effective at mitigating cases. No such trend exists, and to point out the obvious lack of correlation in either of the above charts will have you anathematized by the Church of St. Fauci. "They didn't have a *real* lockdown!" the Covidians will say. Sound familiar? 

### The costs of locking down

Not only have the lockdowns played no role in disease mitigation, they come with tremendous costs. You would think that the pro-lockdown Scientists<sup>TM</sup> informing public health decisions would have contemplated the costs of disrupting global supply chains and forcing hundreds of millions of people to remained shuttered in their homes. No matter. When nations around the globe are at "war" with a virus, immediate action is the only option. Damn the consequences. 

What follows are some of the most alarming costs of the lockdowns, costs the Covidians are likely to have neither heard of nor considered prior to their moral posturing. These costs are brutal, depressing, and further lay to rest the myth that lockdowns save lives.

- The New York Times [predicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html) 1.4 million excess tuberculosis deaths alongside nearly 1 million excess malaria and HIV deaths
- The UN [estimates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger/2020/07/13/0733e34e-c51e-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html) that as many as 130 million people will be at risk of starvation thanks to the lockdown's disruption of global food supply chains
- The CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm) just under 200,000 excess deaths, a [26.5% jump](https://www.dailywire.com/news/new-cdc-numbers-show-lockdowns-deadly-toll-on-young-people) from previous years, attributable to Covid-19 over a 10 month period; a majority of these deaths affected 25-44 year olds
- UNICEF [predicted](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid-19-devastates-already-fragile-health-systems-over-6000-additional-children) an excess of 1.2 million child deaths (ages 5 and under) over a six month period
- The Associate Press [linked](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd) virus-related hunger to 10,000 child deaths per month for the first year of the pandemic
- The CDC [conducted a week long survey in June](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/08/18/the-pandemic-has-caused-an-increase-in-anxiety-stress-depression-and-suicides/?sh=23f44a175863) finding that 25% of young adults between 18-24 years of age have considered suicide because of the pandemic.
- CBS [cited](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-deaths-suicides-drugs-alcohol-pandemic-75000/) a study indicating the potential for 75,000 excess deaths of despair: deaths due to drug and alcohol abuse or suicide
- A CDC report [found](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525797-cdc-pediatric-visits-to-emergency-rooms-for-mental-health-problems?amp&__twitter_impression=true) a 31% increase in mental health-related emergency room visits for children between the ages of 12 and 17 over a three month period.

Quite clearly the lockdowns are doing more harm than good. Even the Atlantic [admitted](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/coronavirus-pandemic-developing-world/614578/) that asking people in low to middle-income countries to stay home is, in many cases, asking them to starve. To point out these grim realities, however, is blaspheming the Science<sup>TM</sup> and, by extension, his holiness Dr. Anthony Fauci!

## “Wear the damn mask.”

This past Wednesday governor Mike DeWine of Ohio went on a lengthy Twitter tirade about the importance of wearing masks. Among many remarks he most foolishly [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20) that we now know "mask wearing . . . is the chief way of slowing this virus.” These statements give the impression that wearing masks slows the spread of Covid-19. The data consistently refute this preposterous claim:

## A brief note on "cases"

This has undoubtedly been a case-driven pandemic. Lockdowns, public health mandates, and societal panic ebb and flow alongside case count. Much, if not all of this panic can be attributed to extremely sensitive PCR tests, which are used to confirm Covid-19 "cases." Quotations around "cases" are warranted given that the vast majority of positive PCR tests are [detecting inert genetic material](https://redstate.com/michael_thau/2020/09/03/ny-times-up-to-90-whove-tested-covid-positive-wrongly-diagnosed-truth-a-whole-lot-worse-pt-2-n253328), essentially "dead" chunks of virus that pose no threat to anybody. A recent New York Times [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html) sums up the PCR sensitivity issue nicely.

>Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles. With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30. In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles. . .

In the same article Juliet Morrison, virologist at the University of California, said any PCR tests running more than 35 cycles are too sensitive. Additionally, Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina recommended a cycle count threshold of 30 or less! The same New York Times article also pointed to the CDC’s own calculations which suggest that “it is extremely difficult to detect any live virus in a sample above a threshold of 33 cycles.”

Ultra sensitive PCR testing leads to an artificially high "case" count, which translates into an artificially high number of Covid-19 hospitalizations&mdash;an excellent analysis of inflated Covid hospitalization numbers can be found [here](https://alachuachronicle.com/death-certificate-review-raises-questions-about-official-number-of-covid-19-deaths/). Simply lowering the sensitivity of PCR tests to realistic levels would crumble Covidian dogmata and end this baseless panic almost instantly. Surprisingly, despite these inflated numbers, United States hospitalization utilization rates [remain under 80 percent](https://twitter.com/SWAtlasHoover/status/1327828349641773058?s=20) in all areas except Rhode Island and Washington, D.C. In some regions, this represents an improvement over the same time period in previous years. 

## Returning to normal life

The data have spoken, and we are long overdue for a return to normal life, not some dystopian, Covidian, and inhuman "new normal" where strangers are faceless pathogens and gatherings are limited to 10 people. The Church of Saint Fauci has the Covidians not only [flaunting their own inhumanity](https://twitter.com/chesschick01/status/1327640852865437698?s=21) like some holy badge of honor, but eager to reduce the rest of their fellow man to passionless biological entities whose sole purpose is nothing more than to remain fed, hydrated, and go through all of life's great experiences on a laptop screen. 

The world desperately needs more anti-Science<sup>TM</sup> individuals like New York City Councilman Joe Borelli, who recently Tweeted the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll be having more than 10 ppl at my house on Thanksgiving. My address is public record. Some family will come from (gasp!) New Jersey.<br><br>Kids will see their grandparents, cousins will play in the yard, sis in law will bring strawberry rhubarb pie, &amp; a turkey will be overcooked.</p>&mdash; Joe Borelli (@JoeBorelliNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBorelliNYC/status/1326608051739234304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Of course this led to infuriated Covidian responses like "You're siding with the virus!", which you will find is the extent of the Covidians' Scientific<sup>TM</sup> rebuttal of anyone who desires their own humanity and doesn't blindly submit to the authority of the Church of Saint Fauci. Imagine telling our ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War against the world's most powerful empire that we also rebelled against our government by, wait for it, hosting a Thanksgiving dinner with *more* than ten people!

Joe Borelli is doing what we should all be doing: fighting for a return to normal life, a life that includes things that give it meaning, like musicals, concerts, professional sporting events, large family gatherings and celebrations, recreational travel, attending religious services, going to comedy shows, and so much more. These things now exist only as shadows in Plato's cave.
