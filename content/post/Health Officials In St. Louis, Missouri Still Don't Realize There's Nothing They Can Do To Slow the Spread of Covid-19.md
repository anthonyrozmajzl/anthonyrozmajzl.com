# Health Officials In St. Louis, Missouri Still Don't Realize There's Nothing They Can Do To Slow the Spread of Covid-19

The covid-19 pandemic will forever server as a sobering reminder for how effortlessly governments can command the unquestioned obedience of their constituents. Political actors, in conjunction with big tech and the corporate press, spent the better part of a year, despite overwhelming data to the contrary, framing the argument for various behavioral controls like mask mandates and business closures as the scientifically approved and morally upright position that any good, rational citizen would take in the name of preserving "public health." This line of thinking has become so thoroughly embedded in our culture that it is now widely accepted that any state, individual, or business that refuses to implement or adhere to forced business closures, mask mandates, gathering restrictions, or other behavioral mandates is de facto a science-denying enemy of public health, fully deserving of legal punishment and public shaming. 

## The Struggle of St. Louis' Most Prominent Venues

Nobody understands this dynamic better than the owners of The Wheelhouse, a 1,000-person venue located in St. Louis, Missouri that has fallen victim to the local government's punitive health mandates. While the state of Missouri currently enjoys [no mask mandate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html), the city of St. Louis has been more than willing to ensure that The Wheelhouse, along with their two sister venues The Midwestern and Start Bar, are bending the knee to local government orders. The Wheelhouse not only commands a respectable portion of the night life in St. Louis, it is also a historical sports venue that was home to the Blues' 2019 Stanley Cup celebration, further affirming the Wheelhouse's prominence as the go-to sports venue in the city. 

Not surprisingly, there was no shortage of complaints about the continued operation of The Wheelouse, Start Bar, and The Midwestern at the beginning of the new year. As consequence, all three venues, each having already been punitively shut down twice during the pandemic&mdash;The Wheelhouse and Start Bar in July and November for two weeks and The Midwestern in December and January for a month&mdash;due to violations of local covid-19 mandates, were hit with a [one year closure order](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2021/01/21/wheelhouse-start-bar-ordered-to-close-until-2022-for-covid-19-violations) by St. Louis' acting Director of Health Dr. Fredrick Echols. With financial destitution on the line for the owners and their 100+ employees, the owners were forced to accept the retaliatory consent order requiring them to operate at 33 percent capacity, pay for social distancing security officers to monitor their venues, and install additional video surveillance equipment that must be accessible to health inspectors and city police on demand. Since the closure notice, business revenue has fallen 70%.

## What Does The Science Have to Say? 

Echols' consent order, along with the dozens of complaints filed to local authorities on behalf of private citizens, is perfectly emblematic of the national attitude toward covid-19 mandates: comply or be treated as a menace to public health. It apparently does not matter to Echols and other local politicians what the data say about the effectiveness of mask mandates, business closures, capacity restrictions, stay-at-home orders, or any other behavioral mandate. What matters to them is that everyone fall in line and, ideally, profess an unwavering faith in the efficacy of mask mandates and social distancing guidelines. However, a true understanding of the data pertaining to the effectiveness of these mandates would require the immediate removal of all covid-19 restrictions, none of which have done a single thing to keep the citizens of St. Louis, Missouri safe. If this city and surrounding areas truly wish to follow the science, their officials will pay close attention to the following data.

![CityStLouis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/109894574-bbd37e00-7c5b-11eb-8ea3-67b689bc2b51.jpeg)

Plain as day, despite having both a mask mandate and capacity restrictions in place at the end of summer, the city of St. Louis saw a massive explosion in cases starting in October&mdash;surely it is just a mere coincidence that every other state in the country experienced this same surge at the same time. Invairably, the above chart will drum up the fraudulent excuse that people suddenly refuesd to comply with the mask mandate when October began. To the contrary, mask data for the city of St. Louis show that public mask compliance has consistently remained [above 90 percent since mid-September](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/?date=20210221&sensor=fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask&region=29510).

Maybe the citizens of St. Louis just all happened to stop taking the virus seriosuly as October rolled around. Well, not exactly. Mobility and social distancing metrics provided by the [University of Maryland Covid-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu) show no drastic behavioral changes at the start of October, which is denoted by the red line. 

![ST LOUIS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110059260-e132bb80-7d31-11eb-8bc5-52d1721422a9.png)

To put the non-compliance narrative to rest, if you check [Google's Covid-19 mobility report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) for the city of St. Louis, you will quickly find that St. Louis residents are thoroughly outperforing Missouri as a whole when it comes to avoiding behaviors that supposedly fuel the spread of covid-19. Although the window of observation for this data is is smaller than preceding data, it paints a pretty clear picture as to how much more "seriously" the citizens of St. Louis are taking this virus compared to the rest of the state. As is shown below, despite their exemplary behavior relative to the rest of the state, the citizens of St. Louis could not escape the October surge, nor was its surge growth rate any less significant than the surrounding areas discussed below. In the chart that follows, statewide numbers for Missouri appear in red.

![St  Louis vs MO as a whole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110154646-7bd2df00-7db2-11eb-86f9-a6927bedb7f0.png)

Based on an actual investigation of the data, it is abundantly clear that the political leadership in St. Louis has made no meaningful impact on cases in their city, but instead have needlessly shut down businesses and enforced punitive mandates under the guise of preserving "public health." For local authorities to simply get away with their castigatory and scientifically unwarranted behavior would be nothing short of criminal.

If Echols and his crew are still not convinced that they've failed miserably in preventing cases within their own city, data from surrounding counties might help them see that, yet again, there is no meaningful correlation between government mandates and case growth patterns.

![StLouisMetro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/109894589-c261f580-7c5b-11eb-90d5-d34df89ee894.jpeg)

For those who have been closely following state and national trends, the above chart should hardly come as a surprise. Here we have three different counties with three very different levels of restrictions, yet they all follow nearly identical case growth patterns. In July, St. Louis County introduced a mask mandate and saw worse case growth in the following month than both Jefferson County and St. Charles County, neither of which had a mask mandate in place. Almost two months later, St. Louis County attempted an "enhanced" mask mandate that again did nothing to prevent the massive case spike in mid-October. In a last-breath effort near the end of November, St. Louis County proceeded to close indoor dining while Jefferson County introduced a mask mandate; St. Charles County continued to do nothing. Miraculously, despite three very different levels and timings of mitigation strategies, all three counties saw their cases plummet at the exact same time &mdash;the jump in cases around January 8 is likely due to [holiday and winter storm reporting lag](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvlnPdDXEAAbeqT?format=jpg&name=large). Most significantly, note how the blatant lack of restrictions in St. Charles County had absolutely no impact on the intensity or timing of their case growth patterns relative to St. Charles and St. Louis County.

Additionally, the wildly different levels of mask compliance across these three counties in early October played no bearing on the timing or intensity of the case growth rate. 

![3 counties mask compliance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110191171-105e3100-7df5-11eb-853e-d6dc4c926c86.png)

While there seems to be a happy correlation between peak case count and mask usage, there is no good explanation as to why St. Louis County, the most restricted of the three counties with the highest level of mask compliance, had worse numbers than St. Charles County, the land of no restrictions, from mid-January through the end of February. Even more, why did St. Charles and Jefferson Counties, each with far worse levels of mask compliance through October, experience practically identical case growth patterns relative to St. Louis County? If the science professed to us by our health experts were true, then there is no good explnation for either of these trends.

Moreover, it would appear that reaturant visits are another useless predictor of covid-19 case patterns.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110211750-0b859580-7e66-11eb-9419-cb11ff09bbbc.PNG)

From April through July, despite Jefferson and St. Charles Counties being far more active in the restaurant scene than St. Louis County, St. Louis County suffered consistently higher cases per million. Secondly, despite no drastic changes in the number of restaurant visits immediately prior to and during October, all three counties still fell prey to the massive October surge at the exact same time and with practically identical growth rates. Thirdly, the drastic impact of St. Louis County's mid-November indoor dining closure on the restaurant business is quite apparaent. It is likely that a majority of this business was displaced to neighboring counties&mdash;Jefferson County and St. Charles County, for example&mdash;whose economies were more conducive to the restaurant industry. Most importantly, the uptick in restaurant visits in St. Charles and Jefferson County during this time also had no effect on their case growth rates relative to St. Louis County. In fact, even as restaurant visits increased in Jefferson and St. Charles County, cases continued to plummet alongisde St. Louis County at a nearly identical rate. 

It is plain as day that neither the level of restaurant activity, mask compliance, nor the number and timing of covid-19 regulations had any bearing on case growth rates in any of these areas. Echols' punitive consent order levied against the owners of The Wheelhouse, Start Bar, and the Midwestern, along with their 100+ employees, was either the result of a gross misunderstanding of simple summary statistics and basic trends, or a vindictive and criminal campaign against those who didn't reflexively submit to government mandates. 

What these politicians are sure to leave out is any discussion around seasonality being a driving factor behind the spread of covid-19. [Research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in Evolutionary Bioinformatics shows that case counts and mortality rates are very strongly correlated with temperature and latitude, both of which even the most pretentious of politicians wouldn't claim the ability to manipulate. If you look at the covid-19 seasonality trends for the United States as a whole, which take into account both tropical and temperate climates, you will quickly find that the cases patterns depcited below match quite nicely with the case patterns for the city of St. Louis and surrounding counties presented above.

![US_Seasonality](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvlnbMPXAAIXJOM?format=jpg&name=large)

The [Hope-Simpson seasonality model for influenze](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C4D90C6E7CB127E6DF7A52D3A9EE2974/S0950268806007175a.pdf/epidemic_influenza_and_vitamin_d.pdf) depicted above has actually been quite accurate in mapping covid-19 trends to tropical and temperate climates. However, for the government officials and their health experts who needlessly ruined livelihoods and brought social life to a depressing standstill for the better part of a year, seasonality cannot, *must* not, be the explanation. It would mean that the past year's worth of politically charged behavioral mandates were all for naught.

## State and National Metrics Further Implicate Echols' Punitive Actions

The claim that government intervention has done anything to slow the spread of covid-19 in the city of St. Louis and surrounding areas has no scientific backing whatsoever. This claim becomes even more dubious if we look at similar metrics from Missouri's neighboring states, or at least those with [similar climates](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuDTiOoVgAI_qtN?format=jpg&name=4096x4096). To start off, here are the population-adjusted case trends for Missouri and Illinois

![Missouri_vs_Illinois](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvnHVsxWYAU8O37?format=jpg&name=large)

The establishment-approved narrative has no explanation for why Missouri and Illinois, the latter being the much more restricted state, experienced almost identical case growth patterns despite drastically varying levels of intervention. Illinois also had [greater mask compliance, less time spent at away locations, and fewer population-adjusted bar and restaurant visits](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/?date=20210221&sensor=fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask&region=IL&compare=MO), which evidently had not even the slightest impact on cases relative to Missouri. In fact, Iillinois had a higher peak case count and is underperforming Missouri to this day. This is sure to generate some crickets among the covid doomers who pride themselves on "following the science."

Now, if you really want to see your "science-following" friends grasping at straws in defense of covid-19 behavioral controls, show them the following graphic of the midwestern states' case trends.

![Midwestern States](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvWOri5XEAA6zJE?format=jpg&name=large)

This really shouldn't come as a surprise, but, yet again, despite nine differnt levels and timings of covid-19 restrictions, all states experienced nearly identical growth patterns. Note particularly that Iowa, the state that [doesn't care if you live or die](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/10/iowa-lift-all-restrictions/), remained under the midwestern average for cases and had the lowest peak case count. Does Echols think that his belligerent retaliation against the owners of The Wheelhouse is going to accomplish something that nine other seasonally congruent states could not?

Let's zoom out even further and take a look at some of the national-level data that further implicate Echols' punitive actions.

![US MASK USAGE VS CASES](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110350957-46243500-8002-11eb-9cb7-5fa37798a1b5.JPG)

The above graphic represents what is likely the most sacreligious assault on the Church of Covid. It blasphemes the divinity of the mask by calling into direct question the notion that mask mandates and mask compliance have been effective in slowing the spread of covid-19. As a matter of very simple fact, the above chart shows zero correlation between mask usage and case counts.

A second area in which find absolutely no correlation is the intensity of a state's restrictions versus deaths per capita.

![State Restrictions vs Covid Deaths Per Capita](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ev_YHdBXcAAp_qH?format=png&name=900x900)

Again, if what we were told about this virus were true, then this graph should unambiguously slope upward indicating that fewer restrictions result in greater casualties. An R<sup>2</sup> of 0.005, however, very clearly indicates that state and local governments have made no impact on the course of the virus through behavioral controls.

What is more, new deaths, new cases, and new hopsitalizations have also been plummeting since January despite [grim warnings](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ev4tT5AWgA8GQtg?format=jpg&name=large) of new variants and millions of people gathering together for Super Bowl LV, neither of which caused the slightest blip in the rate of decline for cases and hospitalizations.

![US Metrics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110402091-c3729880-8048-11eb-937f-c712257a3edd.png)

Lastly, a depicition of all fifty states' case growth rates tell us what your government officials will never admit: despite fifty different timings and levels of  intervention, each state succumbed to nearly an identical case growth pattern. 

![ALL_US_STATES_CASE_PATTERNS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110051560-1e904c80-7d24-11eb-8837-0579c85bf357.png)

Are similar case patterns across fifty diverse states indicative of a government capable of influencing the course of the virus? Hardly. Each state, without deviation, experienced a seasonal bump in cases early to midway through the year followed by a much bigger seasonal surge in cases during winter months. Seemingly every attempt to socially engineer this virus out of existence has failed.

## Place Yourself on the Right Side of History

Years from now, nobody will recognize the government's response to the covid-19 pandemic as anything other than the greatest public health failure in human history. None of the recommendations from our political leaders and health experts for how to beat this pandemic have worked, and we have an entire year's worth of local, statewide, national, and international data to prove it. 

The return to normal life is promising, however. ["Neanderthal"](https://apple.news/AFIRA-QvPSFSM2s1Nsyox2A) states like [Texas](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gov-greg-abbott-lift-texas-mask-mandate-open-state-100-n1259329) and [Missisippi](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gov-greg-abbott-lift-texas-mask-mandate-open-state-100-n1259329), along with [West Viriginia](https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/west-virginia-is-lifting-restrictions-opening-businesses-full-capacity/PCAECM3WOZHZHKUWKV2ZGYMKRA/), [Arizona](https://www.dailywire.com/news/arizonas-governor-lifts-restrictions-on-businesses-that-limit-capacity), [Wyoming](https://governor.wyo.gov/media/news-releases/2021-news-releases/governor-gordon-announces-removal-of-statewide-mask-requirement-lifts-all), and [Connecticut](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/03/04/connecticut-lifting-all-covid-19-capacity-restrictions-on-businesses-including-restaurants-and-gyms/?sh=42fec94115e9), are beginning to let business operate a full capacity and/or removing statewide mask mandates, returning basic freedoms to their constituencies who have all along been perfectly capable of assessing social risk without the guidance of their sainted health officials. Even the Washington Post [recently published an article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vindication-for-ron-desantis-11614986751) saying that Ron DeSantis of Florida can now claim vindication given his success relative to California and New York.

While many states are on the proper path towards normalcy, the vast majority have a long way to go. As is the case with the owners of The Wheelhouse, even if governors lift mask mandates or social distancing guidelines, local authorities can still be a major roadblack on the path towards normal life. And for most individuals, until their governor, mayor, an official in the Biden administartion, or some doctor in a white coat appears on television granting them the ability to resume a life free from masks and social distancing guidelines, they will continue to cling to their safety blanket of social regulations that have had no meaningful impact on the spread of coivd-19. 

In the meantime, we remember those states, cities, and towns that preserved individual liberties and refused to ruin the livelihoods of thousands; we can continue to promulgate the overwhelming amount of data at our disposal which lay the mainstream covid-19 narrative to rest; and we must become emboldened to never again relinquish our most basic freedoms so quickly and so peaceably whenever the ruling elite invoke public health.
