Dismantling the approved Covid-19 narrative&mdash;non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and lockdowns being effective virus mitigation strategies&mdash;has proven to be a formidable challenge. Propagators of the approved Covid-19 narrative have enjoyed the benefits of censorship immunity and their voices being echoed across all major news outlets and social media platforms. They have effectively been shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies with neither scientific nor historical precedent. 

The lack of debate surrounding covid-19 mitigation measures, coupled with the censorship hurdle faced by opponents of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, which I will subsequently refer to as behavioral mandates, has enabled the media to thoroughly embed in the minds of the American people the idea that the masked individual is the good and caring person, while the unmasked individual is a selfish science-denier worthy of punishment and ostracization. This seemingly unalterable narrative rests, of course, on the critical assumption that behavioral mandates and lockdowns are effective tools for virus mitigation.

## Death By Data

The Covid-19 narrative is certainly not unalterable. There is simply too much data to come to any other conclusion than behavioral mandates and lockdowns being incredibly ineffective virus mitigation strategies. A couple months ago, the author had [demonstrated](https://mises.org/wire/theres-still-no-evidence-either-lockdowns-or-masks-are-game-changers) the ineffectiveness of mask mandates and lockdowns using a plethora of data visualizations. Additionaly, you can read [30 studies](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/) showing no clear benefit to state-imposed lockdowns as virus mitigation strategies. We also know of the disproportionately deadly [costs](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) associated with lockdowns and can point to numerous visualizations highlighting their ineffectiveness. 

But there is one visualization in particular, courtesy of [Hold2](https://twitter.com/Hold2llc), that lays the official Covid-19 narrative to rest. It compares hospitalizations and deaths in Flordia with those in New York and California, the latter two being highly touted examples of states that had "followed the science."

![FL vs Others](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtotegIXIBM6ALs?format=jpg&name=large)

How is it possible that Florida, a fully open and popular travel destination with one of the oldest populations in the country, currently has lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California, a state with heavy restrictions and one of the youngest populations in the country? The establishment-approved science simply cannot answer this question. Yes, overall California does slightly better than Florida in deaths per million, but this can be explained away largely in part by the vast age discrepancy which heavily favors youthful California. 

Florida has zero restrictions on bars, breweries, indoor dining, gyms, places of worship, gathering sizes, and almost all schools are offering in-person instruction. California and New York, on the other hand, still retain [heavy restrictions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUGlYbXUAcyNrK?format=jpg&name=large) in all of these areas. At the *very* least, Florida's hospitalizations and deaths per million should be phenomenally worse than California's and New York's. Those who predicted death and destruction as a consequence of Flordia's September reopening simply cannot see these results as anything other than utterly remarkable. 

## Is Compliance The Secret Behind Florida's Success?

Invariably, this graph will invoke responses pointing to Californians' and New Yorkers' supposed lack of compliance. Relative to Florida, this claim is patently absurd on its face given the fact that Florida has been fully open since mid-September. Does anybody sincerely believe that Florida's numbers are lower because they're complying with mask mandates and social regulations better than California and New York? Certianly not. Floridians are consistently demonized as selfish, anti-science individuals who deserve every death coming their way. A quick glance at the reactions to a [recent video](https://twitter.com/SamBrockNBC/status/1357047400548950023?s=20) of a maskless supermarket in Collier County, Florida should be enough to convince you of the general animosity held by most towards Floridians. 

If it one's genuine belief that Californians are doing a worse job complying than Floridians, then we can look at a few indicators that would tell us how heavily Floridians and Californians are complying with measures that supposedly help reduce covid-19 transmission. The following survey data&mdash;California is in blue and Florida is in gray&mdash;is taken from Carnegie Mellon University's [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210201&region=FL). To the right of the red vertical line in each of the following graphs is the time period in which Florida had consistently lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California. 

##### Mask Compliance

##### Bar Vists

##### Traveling

![Away Locations FL vs CA](/images/AwayLocationsFLvsCA.png)

##### Restaurant Visits

![Restaurant Visits Fl vs CA](/images/RestaurantVisitsFLvsCA.png)

Past the red vertical line, where Florida's deaths and hospitalizations per million were lower than California's, there is no apparent change in behavior indicating that Floridians suddenly started to avoid the behaviors favorable to covid transmission.  

Furthermore, are we expected to believe that prior to November 5, when California had *lower* hopitalizations and deaths per million than Florida, that Californians were doing a great job complying? Then, less than two months later, Californians unanimously stopped complying as they fell behind Florida in both metrics? This ridiculously dubious claim is at direct odds with the behavioral patterns shown above. Additionally, a quick glance at each state's ["social distancing score"](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) indicates, yet again, that Californians have been doing a better job avoiding activities meant to facilitate the spread of covid-19. Finally, Google's [covid mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) as of February 2, 2021, show that Californians have fewer retail and recreational visits&mdash;restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters&mdash; as well has fewer grocery store and pharmacy visits, which include farmers markets, food warehouses, and speciality food shops. Clearly, the whole non-compliance schtick is nothing more than a convenient excuse to explain away undesirable trends. Relative to Floridians, Californians have consistently been doing a better job of avoiding social behaviors that allegedly fuel the spread of covid-19, but with no results to show for it.

Moving away briefly from the Flordia-California comparison, national metrics also highlight the lack of correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and deaths per million.

![50 States Restriction vs Deaths Per Million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqf4ZzjW4AAtgwQ?format=jpg&name=900x900)

In fact, if we visualize the trend in cases across all fifty states, each state having varying levels of restrictions, you'll quickly notice a pattern that presents itself nearly identically across all fifty states: a bump in cases early in the year followed by a much bigger surge in cases during winter months. 

![50 State Case Trends](/images/Case_Trends_All_50_States.png)

The pattern depicted above supports the idea that governments have no control over the path taken by the virus. Rather, it appears that a simple changing of seasons, or "seasonality," is the key variable affecting case patterns. [Research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in *Evolutionary Bioinformatics* show that case counts and mortaility rates are strongly correlated with temperature and latitude, again reinforcing the claim that legislative fiat cannot defeat covid-19. It is very likely that we will start speaking of "covid season" in the same way we speak of "flu season." A good visual of what covid season might look like in tropical and temperate climates can be found [here](https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1358658394564009985?s=21).

Circling back to Collier County, FL, home of the infamous maskless supermarket, it would be suspected, according to the mainstream narrative, that this defiant county is experiencing deaths on a massive scale. Let's compare deaths in science-denying Collier County to science-following Imperial County, CA, which has had a mask mandate since April.

![Collier, FL vs Imperial County, CA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtWicZrVgAMRrTI?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Based on everything we're supposed to believe about the virus, there is no explanation for the fact that Collier County is outperforming Imperial County, and by a long shot. 

We can even take a look at counties within the same state&mdash;removing the climate/seasonality discrepancy&mdash;to see whether or not mask mandates have had any noticeable impact on cases. Let's compare Collier County, FL with its neighbor Charlotte County, which has had a mask mandate since late July.

![Collier, FL vs Charlotte, FL](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtaYwP-UcAACDpW?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Here are few more charts showing, yet again, that regardless of the timing or existence of mask mandates, similar regions follow the same case growth patterns, again strongly supporting the notion of seasonality

![DC Metro](https://twitter.com/ianmsc/status/1358685783666745345?s=21)

It is quite strange that different cities/counties within the same area, all with varying timings and degrees of certain restrictions, just happened to follow nearly identical case patterns. Instead of accepting our inability to socially engineer a respiratory virus out of existence, sanity and normal life can be quickly restored by embracing the reality of seasonality.

## Update on the Holiday Surge and Alabama Superspreader Event

Some of you may be wondering what happened to the "holiday surge" that was supposed to be ravaging our hospitals right about now. Well, it never happened. Not only did the rate of covid-19 hospitalization growth *decline* after Thanksgiving, hospitalizations peaked less than two weeks after Christmas and have been sharply plummeting since! 

![The "Holiday Surge"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtV5wO2VkAAq_cO?format=jpg&name=medium)

Finally, as a bonus for those of you who like to keep up to date on the latest installments of The Media Who Cried Superspreader, Alabma came under heavy fire after [thousands of maskless football fans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tuscaloosa-celebration-alabama-national-championship-covid-19-concerns/) took to the streets to celebrate their team winning the national college football title. Fansided was [quick to label](https://fansided.com/2021/01/12/alabama-football-fans-defy-covid-guidelines-super-spreader-celebration-strip-videos/) the large celebration as a superspreader event, and health officials were [worried](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/health-officials-worry-alabama-football-celebration-was-superspreader-event.html) that the Alabama superspreader was going to result in a huge case spike. Here's what really happened.

![Alabama vs Missisippi Nat'l Championship](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etkd1TBVgAEuAor?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Miraculously, cases immediately plummeted after the "superspreader" event and continue to plummet to this day. If that wasn't enough, Mississippi, Alabama's next-door neighbor, followed a nearly identical case pattern despite hosting no superspreader events. But don't hold your breath for any sort of apology from the health officials or media outlets that predicted doom and gloom for Alabama. 

## Conclusion

[Recent data](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9219379/Why-coronavirus-cases-falling-fast-New-infections-drop-44-three-weeks.html) show that in the past few weeks, cases have fallen 45% in the United States, 30% globally, and hospitalizations have dropped 26% since their mid-January peak. The same data also suggest that it's far too soon to attribute this rapid decline to vaccinations, leading to a general confusion as to how we've achieved these numbers. Are we going to hear that populations around the world unanimoulsy began complying with covid regulations, or that governments are finally cracking down and getting serious about enforcing their mandates? Possibly, but only as long as cases and hospitalizations continue to trend downwards. It is very unlikely, however, that health officials will start admitting that seasonality appears to be the most rational explanation for the year's worth of data showing very similar case trends across all fifty states, despite a myriad of mitigation strategies. Accepting that seasonality was primarily responsible for case fluctuations will be an exceptionally bitter pill to swallow and nearly impossible to reconcile with the emotional attachment to mask mandates and other non-pharmaceuticl interventions. It would mean that nearly a year's worth of heavily politicized behavioral mandates, life-destroying lockdowns, and devastating business closures were all for naught. 

Even if trends continue such that a return to normalcy seems more likely, it's not clear that everyone would prefer a return to normal life. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1357082538020339712?s=20) plans to ease current restrictions on gathering capacities. Responses to this's tweet&mdash;as with responses to similar tweets from other governors&mdash;indicate that many people still prefer to remain wrapped up in their safety blanket of social regulations. This is a significant challenge to overcome, but with the sheer amount of data which consistently show the futility of both mask mandates and lockdowns, the challenege is certainly not insurmountable. The truths embedded in the data cannot be kept hidden forever.
