American Airlines has arrested and permanently banned a passenger who refused to wear a mask while preventing a terrorist attack that would have killed 150 passengers. Reports claim that although the man happily complied with mask protocol after detaining the terrorist, he refused to honor the requests of passengers and flight attendants to wear a mask for the 30 seconds he spent disarming the terrorist of his explosive device. 

CNN was providing live coverage on the situation with the heroic headline: "Domestic terrorist intentionally exposes 150 people to deadly virus." 

"Let me make myself very clear," Chris Cuomo told his live CNN audience. "The real terrorist was that moron who refused to hashtag mask up. Now we have 150 innocent men, women, and children who are going to be dead in only a matter of weeks, infecting millions more along the way!" Cuomo yelled to the cameras as he clutched his $45 Dr. Fauci Amigurumi doll.

One morbidly obese passengers who was on the flight recounted her traumatic experience to the media. "That man who 'saved' us from the terrorist put my health and everyone else's health in jeopardy by refusing to wear a mask," the woman told reporters after a five-second draw on her cigarette. "How could anyone be so selfish?" she wheezed. "For God's sake, even the terrorist who wanted to blow us up had the decency to wear a mask as he threatened to kill us."

Reporters who were on the scene after the plane had landed overheard many passengers calling friends and family to say their final goodbyes, often lamenting that they could already feel the covid-19 particles coursing through their blood.

The Biden Administration will be holding a pre-emptive funeral service for all passengers within the next few days and are unconcerned with the whereabouts of the terrorist who planned to bomb the plane.
