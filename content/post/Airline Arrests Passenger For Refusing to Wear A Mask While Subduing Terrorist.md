American Airlines has permanently banned and arrested a passenger for refusing to put on a mask as he successfully foiled a hi-jacker's plot to blow up the plane carrying 100 passengers. 

After the plane had landed, one morbidly obese passenger recounted her traumatic experience to the media. "That man who 'saved' us from the terrorist put my health, and the health of 60 other passengers in jeopardy by refusing to mask up," the woman told reporters as she choked on cigarette smoke. "How could anyone be so selfish?" she continued. "For God's sake, even the *terrorist* had the decency to wear a mask as he threatened to kill all of us."

"I just don't want to get our labels confused here," another passenger told the press. "The *real* terrorist was that moron who refused to pull his mask up as he disarmed the terrorist. There's absolutely no excuse for that kind of reckless behavior!" the man yelled to the cameras as he clutched is $45 Dr. Fauci Amigurumi doll.

Many of the passengers were also overheard calling friends and family to say their final goodbyes as they felt the newly acquired covid-19 particles coursing through their blood.

Amidst the traumatic outrage over the man who refused to wear his mask properly, the terrorist who planned to blow up the plane simply slipped away undetected. However, authorities did not seem too concerned with his whereabouts. "The real terrorist was brought to justice today," one FBI agent told reporters as he added the maskless man's information into some sketchy-looking database.
