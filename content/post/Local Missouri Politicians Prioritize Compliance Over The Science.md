If the covid-19 pandemic has reminded us of one thing, it is how effortlessly governments can command the unquestioned obedience of their constituents. Political actors, in conjunction with big tech and the corporate press, spent the better part of a year framing the argument for various behavioral controls such as mask mandates and business closures as the scientifically validated and morally upright position that any good, rational citizens would take in the name of preserving "public health." This line of thinking has become so thoroughly embedded in our culture that it is now widely accepted that any individual or business that questions or defies forced business closures, mask mandates, gathering restrictions, or other behavioral mandates is de facto an enemy of public health; a science-denier fully deserving of legal punishment and public scorn.  

## A Criminally Unscientifc Series of Shutdowns in St. Louis, Missouri

Nobody understands this dynamic better than the owners of The Wheelhouse, a 1,000-person venue located in St. Louis, Missouri that has fallen victim to the local government's punitive health mandates. While the state of Missouri currently enjoys [no mask mandate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html), the city of St. Louis has been more than willing to ensure that The Wheelhouse, along with their sister venues Start Bar and The Midwestern, comply with government orders. The Wheelhouse not only commands a respectable portion of the night life in St. Louis, it is also a historical sports venue that was home to the Blues' 2019 Stanley Cup celebration, further affirming the Wheelhouse's prominence as the go-to sports venue in the city. 

Naturally, all eyes would remain on the Wheelhouse as the pandemic rolled in. The owners remained compliant with regulations early on, but were soon prohibited from entertaining anybody indoors. Having well over 100 employees to support and a 7 year-old business to sustain, The Wheelhouse, along with its sister venues, slowly began catering back to the comfort of customers beginning in May. As June came around, crowds were growing to such an extent that The Wheelhouse and Start Bar saw their first punitive two week closure in July.

The flood of reports to local officials and phony images are perfectly emblematic of the culture of unquestioned obedience to covid-19 mandates.

## NOTES

This new version of public health has brushed aside basic freedoms and completed ignored any and all data showing the utter futility of the past year's worth of behavioral mandates in favor of the feeling of safety that comes with living in a culture of unquestioned compliance to the powers that be.

Private citizens, now emboldened by their establishment-backed narrative that compliance with behavioral mandates is the selfless and scientifically prudent path to defeating covid, find it their duty to publicly berate non-mask-wearers and rat out non-compiant businesses, convincing others that both as menaces to society. As a result, many individuals and private businesses, whether to avoid shutdowns, heated public confrontations, or deter fines, are forced to reluctantly fall in line with government mandates.
