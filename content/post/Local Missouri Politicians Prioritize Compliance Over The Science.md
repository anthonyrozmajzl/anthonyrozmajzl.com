# Local Missouri Politicians Prioritize Compliance Over The Science

If the covid-19 pandemic has reminded us of one thing, it is how effortlessly governments can command the unquestioned obedience of their constituents. Political actors, in conjunction with big tech and the corporate press, spent the better part of a year framing the argument for various behavioral controls such as mask mandates and business closures as the scientifically validated and morally upright position that any good, rational citizens would take in the name of preserving "public health." This line of thinking has become so thoroughly embedded in our culture that it is now widely accepted that any individual or business that questions or defies forced business closures, mask mandates, gathering restrictions, or other behavioral mandates is de facto an enemy of public health; a science-denier fully deserving of legal punishment and public scorn.  

## The Struggle of St. Louis' Most Prominent Venues

Nobody understands this dynamic better than the owners of The Wheelhouse, a 1,000-person venue located in St. Louis, Missouri that has fallen victim to the local government's punitive health mandates. While the state of Missouri currently enjoys [no mask mandate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html), the city of St. Louis has been more than willing to ensure that The Wheelhouse, along with their sister venues Start Bar and The Midwestern, are bending the knee to local government orders. The Wheelhouse not only commands a respectable portion of the night life in St. Louis, it is also a historical sports venue that was home to the Blues' 2019 Stanley Cup celebration, further affirming the Wheelhouse's prominence as the go-to sports venue in the city. 

Naturally, all eyes would remain on the Wheelhouse as the pandemic rolled in. The owners remained compliant with regulations early on, but were soon prohibited from entertaining anybody indoors. Having well over 100 employees to support and a 7 year-old business to sustain, The Wheelhouse, along with its sister venues, slowly began catering back to the comfort of customers beginning in May. As June came around, crowds were growing to such an extent that The Wheelhouse and Start Bar were handed their first punitive two-week closure in July for violating mask and social distancing guidelines. The second punitive two-week closure came in November as photos surfaced showing large amounts of maskless patrons desecrating the highly venerated 6-foot distancing requirement.

Complaints of the bars' continued operation have continued into the new year, resulting in St. Louis' acting Director of Health Dr. Fredrick Echols' most ridiculous punishment to date: a [one-year closure](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2021/01/21/wheelhouse-start-bar-ordered-to-close-until-2022-for-covid-19-violations) of both The Wheelhouse and Start Bar unless the owners agree to a consent order that requires their businesses to purchase social distancing security officers, install additional video surveillance equipment that must be accessible to health inspeactors and city police on demand, and operate 33 percent capacity, which is more restrictive than other bars in the area. With financial destitution on the line for the owners and their employees&mdash;revenue has fallen 70% since the closure notice&mdash;the owners had no choice but to bend the knee to Echols' demands.

## The Science<sup>TM</sup> vs. The Science

Echols' consent order, combined with the dozens of complaints filed to local authorities on behalf of private citizens, are perfectly emblematic of the national attitude toward covid-19 mandates: follow The Science<sup>TM</sup> or be punished. To follow The Science<sup>TM</sup> requires that you, without question, wear the mask, stand six feet apart, operate your business according to the guidelines handed down by your government officials, and refrain from discussing your loss of personal freedoms or the disatrous costs of such mandates. In stark contrast, actual scientific investigation of the data pertaining to the effectiveness of mask mandates, business closures, and operational capacity guidlines show that none of theses mandates played any role in keeping the citizens of St. Louis, Missouri and surrounding areas safe. We'll begin with the city of St. Louis.

Plain as day, despite having both a mask mandate and capacity restrictions in place since the end of summer, the city of St. Louis saw a massive explosion in cases as October rolled around. The Science<sup>TM</sup> has no explanation for this, other than the pitiful excuse that people suddenly stopped complying with the mask mandate in early October. However, if we look at the mask data for St. Louis during this time, you will see that public mask compliance has remained exceptionally high, thwarting any attempted defense for the October surge.

Rather, if we look at the covid-19 seasonality trend for the United States as a whole, which combines both tropical and temperate climates, we find that the case pattern depcited above for the city of St. Louis matches quite nicely with that of the United States as a whole.

The [Hope-Simpson seasonality model for influenze](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C4D90C6E7CB127E6DF7A52D3A9EE2974/S0950268806007175a.pdf/epidemic_influenza_and_vitamin_d.pdf) depicted above has actually been quite accurate in mapping covid-19 trends to tropical and temperate climates. Moreover, [research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in Evolutionary Bioinformatics shows that case counts and mortality rates are very strongly correlated with temperature and latitude, neither of which even the most pretentious of politicians claim can be manipulated. This research, combined with the trends depcited above, lends overwhelming support to the idea that the past year's worth of behavioral mandates were all for naught, and that Echols' shutdown of the Wheelhouse and Start Bar was nothing short of criminal behavior. 

Moving away briefly from the city of St. Louis, we find even more data from surrounding areas highlighting the futility of the government's attempts to socially engineer covid-19 out of existence.

## NOTES

This new version of public health has brushed aside basic freedoms and completed ignored any and all data showing the utter futility of the past year's worth of behavioral mandates in favor of the feeling of safety that comes with living in a culture of unquestioned compliance to the powers that be.

spent the majority of 2020 unleashing a successful campaign of [mass hysteria](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1376/htm?fbclid=IwAR3hKqZ614zBr9zHXBOuaxTA8Z0Dt9Hb-TxObCY3qdpCJFuqh_Mmh3jCdtQ) and continue to berate the public with pithy slogans like "Wear a mask, slow the spread", and 

Private citizens, now emboldened by their establishment-backed narrative that compliance with behavioral mandates is the selfless and scientifically prudent path to defeating covid, find it their duty to publicly berate non-mask-wearers and rat out non-compiant businesses, convincing others that both as menaces to society. As a result, many individuals and private businesses, whether to avoid shutdowns, heated public confrontations, or deter fines, are forced to reluctantly fall in line with government mandates.

decentralized the government's role of enforcing covid-19 mandates. 

Years from now, populations around the world will recognize their governments' responses to the covid-19 pandemic as some of the greatest public health failures in human history. Not that this shouldn't have been expected; Not only was this one of the greatest failures from a public health standpoint, but just about every little freedom we once took for granted&mdash; going to work, running businesses, visiting family and friends, .....The speed with which politicians and public health experts subdued the social behaviors of states and countries around the world is astonishing. How quickly we went from fiteen days to slow the spread
