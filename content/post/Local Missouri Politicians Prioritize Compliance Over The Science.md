# Local Missouri Politicians Prioritize Compliance Over The Science. There's No Data To Support Their Actions

The covid-19 pandemic should serve as a sober reminder for how effortlessly governments can command the unquestioned obedience of their constituents. Political actors, in conjunction with big tech and the corporate press, spent the better part of a year framing the argument for various behavioral controls such as mask mandates and business closures as the scientifically validated and morally upright position that any good, rational citizen would take in the name of preserving "public health." This line of thinking has become so thoroughly embedded in our culture that it is now widely accepted that any state, individual, or business that refuses to implement or adhere to forced business closures, mask mandates, gathering restrictions, or other behavioral mandates is de facto an enemy of public health and a science-denier who is fully deserving of legal punishment and public scorn.  

## The Struggle of St. Louis' Most Prominent Venues

Nobody understands this dynamic better than the owners of The Wheelhouse, a 1,000-person venue located in St. Louis, Missouri that has fallen victim to the local government's punitive health mandates. While the state of Missouri currently enjoys [no mask mandate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html), the city of St. Louis has been more than willing to ensure that The Wheelhouse, along with their two sister venues The Midwestern and Start Bar, are bending the knee to local government orders. The Wheelhouse not only commands a respectable portion of the night life in St. Louis, it is also a historical sports venue that was home to the Blues' 2019 Stanley Cup celebration, further affirming the Wheelhouse's prominence as the go-to sports venue in the city. 

Not surprisingly, there was no shortage of complaints about the continued operation of The Wheelouse, Start Bar, and The Midwestern at the beginning of the new year. Consequently, all three venues, each having been shut down twice already &mdash;The Wheelhouse and Start Bar in July and November for two weeks and The Midwestern in December and January for a month&mdash;due to violations of local covid-19 mandates, were hit with a [one year closure order](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2021/01/21/wheelhouse-start-bar-ordered-to-close-until-2022-for-covid-19-violations) by St. Louis' acting Director of Health Dr. Fredrick Echols. With financial destitution on the line for the owners and their 100+ employees, the owners were forced to accept the punitive consent order which requires them to operate at 33 percent capacity, pay for social distancing security officers to monitor their venues, and install additional video surveillance equipment that must be accessible to health inspectors and city police on demand. Since the closure notice, business revenue has fallen 70%. Either the owners bent the knee to Echols' punitive demands or be force to permanently close up shop.

## What Does The Science Have to Say? 

Echols' consent order, along with the dozens of complaints filed to local authorities on behalf of private citizens, is perfectly emblematic of the national attitude toward covid-19 mandates: comply or else you are a menace to public health and must be treated as such. It apparently does not matter to Echols and other local politicians what the data say about the effectiveness of mask mandates, business closures, capacity restrictions, stay-at-home orders, or any other behavioral mandate. What matters to them is that everyone fall in line and, ideally, profess an unwavering faith in the efficacy of covid-19 mandates. However, a true understanding of the data pertaining to the effectiveness of these mandates would require the immediate removal of the covid-19 restrictions that have done nothing to keep the citizens of St. Louis, Missouri safe. If the city of St. Louis and surrounding areas truly wish to follow the science, their officials will pay close attention to the following data.

Plain as day, despite having both a mask mandate and capacity restrictions in place at the end of summer, the city of St. Louis saw a massive explosion in cases starting in October. Invairably, the above chart will drum up the fraudulent excuse that people suddenly refuesd to comply with the mask mandate and stopped taking the virus seriosuly. However, mask and mobility data for the city of St. Louis show that public mask compliance has always remained exceptionally high while 

![st_louis_missouri_mask_wearing.pdf](https://github.com/aroz73096/anthonyrozmajzl.com/files/6080558/st_louis_missouri_mask_wearing.pdf)

Moreover, mobility and social distancing metrics&mdash;data provided by the [University of Maryland Covid-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu) from January 1, 2020 through March 1, 2021&mdash;show drastic behavioral changes at the start of October, denoted by the red line.

Finally, [Google's Covid-19 mobility report] for the city of St. Louis, although spanning a narrower observation window, tells us that St. Louis residents are thoroughly beating the state average and surrounding counties when it comes to avoiding the behaviors that supposedly fuel the spread of covid-19. What more information does one need to conclude that the political leadership in St. Louis has made no meaningful impact on cases while unnecessarily shutting down businesses and enforcing punitive mandates in the name of preserving "public health"?

Turning our attention away momentarily from the city of St. Louis to surrounding areas, we find, yet again, no meaningful correlation between government mandates and case growth patterns

![StLouisMetro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/109894589-c261f580-7c5b-11eb-90d5-d34df89ee894.jpeg)

For those who have been closely following state and national trends, the above chart should hardly come as a surprise. Here we have three different counties with three very different levels of restrictions, yet they all follow nearly identical case patterns. In July, St. Louis County introduced a mask mandate and saw worse case growth in the following month than both Jefferson County and St. Charles County, neither of which had a mask mandate in place. Almost two months later, St. Louis County attempted an "enhanced" mask mandate that did nothing to prevent the massive case spike in mid-October. St. Louis County then closed indoor dining while Jefferson County introduced a mask mandate and St. Charles County continued to do nothing. Miraculously, all three counties saw their cases plummet despite three very different strategies&mdash;the jump in cases around June 8 is likely due to [holiday reporting lag](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvlnPdDXEAAbeqT?format=jpg&name=large)

Interestingly, if we look at the covid-19 seasonality trend for the United States as a whole, which combines both tropical and temperate climates, we find that the case pattern depcited above for the city of St. Louis matches quite nicely.

The [Hope-Simpson seasonality model for influenze](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C4D90C6E7CB127E6DF7A52D3A9EE2974/S0950268806007175a.pdf/epidemic_influenza_and_vitamin_d.pdf) depicted above has actually been quite accurate in mapping covid-19 trends to tropical and temperate climates. Moreover, [research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in Evolutionary Bioinformatics shows that case counts and mortality rates are very strongly correlated with temperature and latitude, neither of which even the most pretentious of politicians claim can be manipulated. This research, combined with the trends depcited above, lends overwhelming support to the idea that the past year's worth of behavioral mandates in St. Louis were all for naught, meaning that Echols' shutdown of the Wheelhouse and Start Bar was not only completely unscientfic, but nothing short of criminal.

## NOTES

This new version of public health has brushed aside basic freedoms and completed ignored any and all data showing the utter futility of the past year's worth of behavioral mandates in favor of the feeling of safety that comes with living in a culture of unquestioned compliance to the powers that be.

spent the majority of 2020 unleashing a successful campaign of [mass hysteria](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1376/htm?fbclid=IwAR3hKqZ614zBr9zHXBOuaxTA8Z0Dt9Hb-TxObCY3qdpCJFuqh_Mmh3jCdtQ) and continue to berate the public with pithy slogans like "Wear a mask, slow the spread", and 

Private citizens, now emboldened by their establishment-backed narrative that compliance with behavioral mandates is the selfless and scientifically prudent path to defeating covid, find it their duty to publicly berate non-mask-wearers and rat out non-compiant businesses, convincing others that both as menaces to society. As a result, many individuals and private businesses, whether to avoid shutdowns, heated public confrontations, or deter fines, are forced to reluctantly fall in line with government mandates.

While ["neanderthal"](https://apple.news/AFIRA-QvPSFSM2s1Nsyox2A) states such as Texas and Mississippi (now Connecticut, a democratic state.....gonna be called a neanderthal?) are making phenomenal progress in [rolling back covid-19 mandates](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gov-greg-abbott-lift-texas-mask-mandate-open-state-100-n1259329) and returning basic freedoms to their citizens, Andrew Cuomo [recently anounced](https://nypost.com/2021/03/02/new-yorkers-must-flash-covid-19-passport-to-enter-venues-under-new-program/) a new pilot program that would require New Yorkers to show a covid-19 passport before entering certain venues. 


decentralized the government's role of enforcing covid-19 mandates. 

Years from now, populations around the world will recognize their governments' responses to the covid-19 pandemic as some of the greatest public health failures in human history. Not that this shouldn't have been expected; Not only was this one of the greatest failures from a public health standpoint, but just about every little freedom we once took for granted&mdash; going to work, running businesses, visiting family and friends, .....The speed with which politicians and public health experts subdued the social behaviors of states and countries around the world is astonishing. How quickly we went from fiteen days to slow the spread
