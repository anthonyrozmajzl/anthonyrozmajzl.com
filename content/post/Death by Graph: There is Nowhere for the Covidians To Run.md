Data visualization is a wonderful thing. Being able to simplify raw data helps us understand and see important trends that would otherwise be invisible in the raw data alone. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in exposing Covid-19 trends that rebutt some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert&mdash;by force if necessary&mdash;their wordly brothers and sisters who are lost in their delusional pseudoscience. Church laity and clergy who question the effectiveness of lockdowns, mask mandates, or suggest that Sweden's approach was successful face immediate excommunication. Moreover, the Church of Saint Fauci's dogma is infallible&mdash;"Lockdowns save lives!", "Wear the damn mask!", "Do what you're told!", and others have become cornerstone teachings of the Church. But what can simple data analysis tell us about two of the Church of Saint Fauci's most cherished dogmata? Let's have a look.

## “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors and public health officials shut down their economies by legislative fiat&mdash;go democracy!&mdash;in an effort to do something, *anything* to slow the spread. Unemployment and social isolation were mandated for millions. Questioning these Scientific<sup>TM</sup> mandates relegated one to the lowly status of a haircut-loving grandma killer. But after only a few months of lockdown it became clear that there was no correlation between how soon a region locked down and deaths:

Locking down quickly clearly did not matter, but what about locking down in general? Surely the strictest lockdowns are saving the most lives, right? Hardly.

If the Covidians' cherished dogma were true, we would expect to see an obvious downward trend showing smaller case increases for countries with higher lockdown stringencies. We see no such correlation. To point out the obvious lack of correlation in any of the above charts will have you anathematized by the Church of St. Fauci. "That wasn't a real lockdown!" they'll say. Sound familiar?


### The costs of locking down

Not only have the lockdowns played no role in disease mitigation, more recent data have shown that the costs of locking down *far* outweigh the perceived benefits. You would think that the pro-lockdown Scientists<sup>TM</sup> informing public health decisions would have examined the costs of disrupting global supply chains, mandating unemployment for millions, and throwing people into abject poverty. Even the Atlantic [admitted](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/coronavirus-pandemic-developing-world/614578/) that by asking people in low to middle income countries to stay home, in many cases you are asking them to starve. But no matter. When nations around the globe are at "war" with a virus, the best action is any immediate action.

What follows are some of the most alarming costs associated with the lockdowns, and the Covidians are guaranteed to have never heard of them. These costs are brutal, depressing, and lay to rest the myth that lockdowns save lives.

- The New York Times [predicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html) an 1.4 million excess tuberculosis deaths alongside nearly 1 million excess malaria and HIV deaths
- The UN [estimates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger/2020/07/13/0733e34e-c51e-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html) that as many as 130 million people will be at risk of starvation thanks to the lockdown's disruption of global food supply chains
- The CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm) just under 200,000 excess deaths, a [26.5% jump](https://www.dailywire.com/news/new-cdc-numbers-show-lockdowns-deadly-toll-on-young-people) from previous years, attributable to Covid-19; a majority of these deaths affecting 25-44 year olds
- UNICEF [predicts](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid-19-devastates-already-fragile-health-systems-over-6000-additional-children) an excess of 1.2 million child death (ages 5 and under) in a six month period
- The Associate Press [linked](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd) virus-related hunger to 10,000 child deaths per month
- The CDC [conducted a week long survey in June](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/08/18/the-pandemic-has-caused-an-increase-in-anxiety-stress-depression-and-suicides/?sh=23f44a175863) finding that 25% of young adults between 18-24 years of age have considered suicide because of the pandemic.
- CBS [cited](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-deaths-suicides-drugs-alcohol-pandemic-75000/) a study indicating the potential for 75,000 excess deaths of despair: deaths due to drug and alcohol abuse or suicide
- A CDC report [found](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525797-cdc-pediatric-visits-to-emergency-rooms-for-mental-health-problems?amp&__twitter_impression=true) a 31% increase in mental health-related emergency room visits for children between the ages of 12 and 17 compared to 2019 from March to October.

Quite clearly the lockdowns are doing far more harm than good. To point out these grim realities, however, is blaspheming the Science<sup>TM</sup> and, by extension, his holiness Dr. Anthony Fauci! To defy or even question lockdown orders is tantamount to murder in the eyes of the Covidians. For any Covidians and non-Covidians who are curious to read more about the physical, mental, and social health consequences of locking down, head over to [Collateral Global](https://collateralglobal.org) and [thepriceofpanic.com](http://thepriceofpanic.com). It will become very clear that lockdowns are not saving lives. 


## “Wear the damn mask.”
    - This past Wednesday gov Mike DeWine implored his constituency to wear a mask so that others might live(https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20). He went on to tweet ["we now know \[that mask wearing\] is the chief way of slowing this virus.”] (https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20). He quoted words attributed to Winston Churchill during WWII: “When you’re going through hell, keep going!" He feigned regret regret of having to shut down bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, etc., knowing full well that this would have no effect on his ability to put bread on his table and feed his family. His Holiness, Dr. Anthony Fauci,  recently declared ex cathedra that now is the time to "Do what you're told." - https://twitter.com/deaceproducer/status/1327256913248198661?s=21. The dogmatic pronouncements of the Church of Saint Fauci are infallible, and the Church's faithful are ready to enforce these dictates at the drop of a hat.
    
Maybe these statements wouldn’t be so utterly embarrassing if the data showed any correlation between mask wearing and cases. I’m not even arguing that mask mandates should have produced massive drop in cases, but there should be at least even the tiniest indication that wearing masks reduces cases. Let’s observe a few areas around the world to see what mask wearing has accomplished:

        - Kentucky, Utah, Colorado, (UK, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden)

- "Sweden was a failure"
        - I recommend extreme caution when talking about Sweden. Noting the phenomenal success of Sweden’s “battle” with Covid-19 will likely invoke hissing more unbearable than           a vampire being pressed with a silver crucifix in broad daylight. 
        - Most attempts at rebutting Sweden’s success start with mentioning Sweden’s high death rate. Yes, their death rate was high, but this was due to a poor management of          nursing homes. Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren admitted (https://news.yahoo.com/sweden-admits-failure-protect-elderly-care-homes-024202762.html) that            Sweden failed to protect their elderly. As of April 28, 90 percent of those who died from Covid-19 were over 70 years old. Half of these deaths occurred in nursing             homes and another quarter occurred during at-home care

    - The vast majority of the population is now okay with sitting at home and watching TV to figure out what their governors and local officials are going to allow them to do for the day.
