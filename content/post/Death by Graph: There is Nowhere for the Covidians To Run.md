Data visualization is a wonderful thing. Through the use of charts and graphs data visualization tools help us understand and see important trends that are invisible in the raw data. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in revealing Covid-19-related trends that rebutt some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

The Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert--by force if necessary--their wordly brothers and sisters who are lost in their delusional pseudoscience. Current members who question the effectiveness of lockdowns, mask mandates, or simply suggest that Sweden's approach might have been successful face immediate excommunication. CSF's dogma is infallible, undebatable, and settled for eternity . . . at least according to its current memebrs. Let's take a look at what the data say about CSF's two most cherished beliefs.

1) “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors and public health officials shut down their economies by legislative fiat without a single vote--go democracy! Unemployment and social isolation were mandated for millions. Questioning these Scientific<sup>TM</sup> mandates was deeply frowned upon. Nevertheless, after only a couple of months of lockdown data analysis [showed](https://www.aier.org/article/did-the-lockdown-save-lives/) that there was no correlation between deaths and the speed with which nations and states shut down:

What about the correlation between lockdowns in general and deaths? Surely those nations which locked down hardest will have saved the most lives, right? Hardly.

If this chart shows anything, it shows that there is absolutely zero correlation between Covid-19 deaths and lockdown stringency. Countries with the highest stringencies appear across all areas of both graphs. If the Covidians' cherished slogan were true, all green and yellow bars would be on the left side of the top chart while all red and black bars would be on the right side of the lower chart. Here is one more chart showing, yet again, pracitcally zero correation between case growth and lockdown stringency.

To point out the obvious lack of any meaningful correlation within the two charts above will have you anathematized by the Church of St. Fauci. "That wasn't a real lockdown!" the Covidians will shout. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

        "The CDC analyzed hospital data from 47 states that comprised about 75 percent of nationwide emergency room visits. One in 85 pediatric visits were mental health-related from March to October in 2019, compared to one in 60 in 2020."





- “Wear the damn mask”
    - This past Wednesday gov Mike DeWine implored his constituency to wear a mask so that others might live(https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20). He went on to tweet ["we now know \[that mask wearing\] is the chief way of slowing this virus.”] (https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20). He quoted words attributed to Winston Churchill during WWII: “When you’re going through hell, keep going!" He feigned regret regret of having to shut down bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, etc., knowing full well that this would have no effect on his ability to put bread on his table and feed his family. His holiness (Fauci) recently declared ex cathedra that it's time to "Do what you're told." - https://twitter.com/deaceproducer/status/1327256913248198661?s=21. The dogmatic pronouncements of the Church of Saint Fauci are infallible, and the Church's faithful are ready to enforce these dictates at the drop of a hat.
    
Maybe these statements wouldn’t be so utterly embarrassing if the data showed any correlation between mask wearing and cases. I’m not even arguing that mask mandates should have produced massive drop in cases, but there should be at least even the tiniest indication that wearing masks reduces cases. Let’s observe a few areas around the world to see what mask wearing has accomplished:

        - Kentucky, Utah, Colorado, (UK, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden)

- "Sweden was a failure"
        - I recommend extreme caution when talking about Sweden. Noting the phenomenal success of Sweden’s “battle” with Covid-19 will likely invoke hissing more unbearable than           a vampire being pressed with a silver crucifix in broad daylight. 
        - Most attempts at rebutting Sweden’s success start with mentioning Sweden’s high death rate. Yes, their death rate was high, but this was due to a poor management of          nursing homes. Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren admitted (https://news.yahoo.com/sweden-admits-failure-protect-elderly-care-homes-024202762.html) that            Sweden failed to protect their elderly. As of April 28, 90 percent of those who died from Covid-19 were over 70 years old. Half of these deaths occurred in nursing             homes and another quarter occurred during at-home care

- Closing:
    - The vast majority of the population is now okay with sitting at home and watching TV to figure out what their governors and local officials are going to allow them to do for the day.
