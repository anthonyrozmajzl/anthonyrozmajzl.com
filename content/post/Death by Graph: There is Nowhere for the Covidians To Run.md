Data visualization is a wonderful thing. Being able to simplify raw data helps us understand and see important trends that would otherwise be invisible in the raw data alone. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in exposing Covid-19 trends that rebutt some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert&mdash;by force if necessary&mdash;their wordly brothers and sisters who are lost in their delusional pseudoscience. Church laity and clergy who question the effectiveness of lockdowns, mask mandates, or suggest that Sweden's approach was successful face immediate excommunication. Moreover, the Church of Saint Fauci's dogma is infallible&mdash;"Lockdowns save lives!", "Wear the damn mask!", "Do what you're told!", and others have become cornerstone teachings of the Church. But what can simple data analysis tell us about two of the Church of Saint Fauci's most cherished dogmata? Let's have a look.

## “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors and public health officials shut down their economies by legislative fiat&mdash;go democracy!&mdash;in an effort to do something, *anything* to slow the spread. Unemployment and social isolation were mandated for millions. Questioning these Scientific<sup>TM</sup> mandates relegated one to the lowly status of haircut-loving grandma killer. But after only a few months of lockdown it became clear that there was no correlation between how soon a region locked down and deaths:

Locking down quickly clearly did not matter, but what about locking down in general? Surely the strictest lockdowns are saving the most lives, right? Hardly.

If Covidian lockdown dogma were correct, we would expect to see an obvious downward-sloping scatter plot indicating that more stringent lockdowns prevent more cases. No such trend exists in the chart. And to point out the obvious lack of correlation in either of the above charts will have you anathematized by the Church of St. Fauci. "They didn't have a *real* lockdown!" they'll yell. Sound familiar?


### The costs of locking down

Not only have the lockdowns played no role in Covid-19 mitigation, recent data show that the costs of locking down *far* outweigh the perceived benefits. You would think that the pro-lockdown Scientists<sup>TM</sup> informing public health decisions would have examined the costs of disrupting global supply chains, mandating unemployment for millions, and throwing people into abject poverty. Even the Atlantic [admitted](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/coronavirus-pandemic-developing-world/614578/) that asking people in low to middle-income countries to stay home is, in many cases, asking them to starve. But no matter. When nations around the globe are at "war" with a virus, the only course of action is immediate action.

What follows are some of the most alarming costs associated with the lockdowns, and the Covidians are guaranteed to have never heard of them. These costs are brutal, depressing, and lay to rest the myth that lockdowns save lives.

- The New York Times [predicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html) 1.4 million excess tuberculosis deaths alongside nearly 1 million excess malaria and HIV deaths
- The UN [estimates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger/2020/07/13/0733e34e-c51e-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html) that as many as 130 million people will be at risk of starvation thanks to the lockdown's disruption of global food supply chains
- The CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm) just under 200,000 excess deaths, a [26.5% jump](https://www.dailywire.com/news/new-cdc-numbers-show-lockdowns-deadly-toll-on-young-people) from previous years, attributable to Covid-19; a majority of these deaths affecting 25-44 year olds
- UNICEF [predicted](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid-19-devastates-already-fragile-health-systems-over-6000-additional-children) an excess of 1.2 million child death (ages 5 and under) over a six month period
- The Associate Press [linked](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd) virus-related hunger to 10,000 child deaths per month
- The CDC [conducted a week long survey in June](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/08/18/the-pandemic-has-caused-an-increase-in-anxiety-stress-depression-and-suicides/?sh=23f44a175863) finding that 25% of young adults between 18-24 years of age have considered suicide because of the pandemic.
- CBS [cited](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-deaths-suicides-drugs-alcohol-pandemic-75000/) a study indicating the potential for 75,000 excess deaths of despair: deaths due to drug and alcohol abuse or suicide
- A CDC report [found](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/525797-cdc-pediatric-visits-to-emergency-rooms-for-mental-health-problems?amp&__twitter_impression=true) a 31% increase in mental health-related emergency room visits for children between the ages of 12 and 17 over a three month period.

Quite clearly the lockdowns are doing far more harm than good. To point out these grim realities, however, is blaspheming the Science<sup>TM</sup> and, by extension, his holiness Dr. Anthony Fauci! To defy or even question lockdown orders is tantamount to murder in the eyes of the Covidians. For anyone curious to read more about the physical, mental, and social health consequences of locking down, head over to [Collateral Global](https://collateralglobal.org) and [thepriceofpanic.com](http://thepriceofpanic.com). It will become very clear that lockdowns are not saving lives. 


## “Wear the damn mask.”

This past Wednesday governor Mike DeWine of Ohio went on a fairly lengthy Twitter tirade about the importance of wearing masks. Among many things he implored his constituency to wear masks so that their [friends, family, and neighbors may live](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20). Most foolishly he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20) that we now know "mask wearing . . . is the chief way of slowing this virus.” These statements give the average person the impression that there is some relationship between mask wearing and cases. I'm not saying there needs to be a massive drop in cases to entertain the idea of a mask mandate, but there should at leaset be *some* noticeable drop. I think it would be wonderful if we could all wear masks for a month and be done, but the data consistently show no correlation between mask wearing and cases. Let’s observe some different areas around the world to see just how little mask wearing has helped:

- "Sweden was a failure"
        - I recommend extreme caution when talking about Sweden. Noting the phenomenal success of Sweden’s “battle” with Covid-19 will likely invoke hissing more unbearable than           a vampire being pressed with a silver crucifix in broad daylight. 
        - Most attempts at rebutting Sweden’s success start with mentioning Sweden’s high death rate. Yes, their death rate was high, but this was due to a poor management of          nursing homes. Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren admitted (https://news.yahoo.com/sweden-admits-failure-protect-elderly-care-homes-024202762.html) that            Sweden failed to protect their elderly. As of April 28, 90 percent of those who died from Covid-19 were over 70 years old. Half of these deaths occurred in nursing             homes and another quarter occurred during at-home care

    - The vast majority of the population is now okay with sitting at home and watching TV to figure out what their governors and local officials are going to allow them to do for the day.
