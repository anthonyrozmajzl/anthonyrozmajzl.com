Data visualization is a wonderful thing. Through the use of charts and graphs data visualization tools help us understand and see important trends that are invisible in the raw data. Now more than ever, data analysts have been instrumental in revealing Covid-19-related trends that rebutt some of the most widely accepted and mythical slogans of the pro-lockdown, militant mask-wearing crowd, a crowd whose members we will subsequently refer to as the Covidians. 

The Covidians are zealous apostles of the Church of Saint Fauci, bearers of the one true Science<sup>TM</sup>, eager to convert--by force if necessary--their wordly brothers and sisters who are lost in their delusional pseudoscience. Current members who question the effectiveness of lockdowns, mask mandates, or simply suggest that Sweden's approach might have been successful face immediate excommunication. CSF's dogma is infallible, undebatable, and settled for eternity . . . at least according to its current memebrs. Let's take a look at what the data say regarding CSF's most cherished beliefs.

1) “Lockdowns save lives.”

It has been [nearly a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747) since the first round of lockdowns. Without any historical or scientific precedent indicating that lockdowns were even remotely effective at saving lives, governors and public health officials shut down their economies without a single vote--go democracy! Unemployment and social isolation were mandated for millions. Questioning these Scientific<sup>TM</sup> mandates was frowned upon. Nevertheless, early data analysis [showed](https://www.aier.org/article/did-the-lockdown-save-lives/) fairly early on that there was no correlation between deaths and the speed with with nations and states shut down:

The above graph doesn't tell us anything about whether lockdowns were effective in generalWell, that wasn't a real lockdown. You need to lock down harder

PANDATA chart.....maybe a couple of mask charts (ITaly is a good one, Colorado is a good one, see Tom Woods email screenshot for three leftist states that are experiencing huge spikes)


- “Cases” are the most important metric
    - PCR testing
    - Any mention of cases without mentioning testing levels is tantamount to lying
        - You don’t have cases if people don’t get tested


- “Wear the damn mask”
    - This past Wednesday gov Mike DeWine implored his constituency to wear a mask so that others might live(https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326659271573069829?s=20). He went on to tweet that mask wearing is “the chief way of slowing this virus.” (https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1326657870667128841?s=20). He quoted words attributed to Winston Churchill during WWII: “When you’re going through hell, keep going! He feigned the potential regret of having to shut down bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, etc., knowing full well that this would have no effect on his ability to put bread on his table and feed his family. DeWine’s entire Twitter feed from 11/10 is filled with statement after statement worthy of high priest in the Church of St. Fauci. Maybe these statements wouldn’t be so utterly embarrassing if the data showed any correlation between mask wearing and cases. I’m not even arguing that mask mandates should have produced massive drop in cases, but there should be at least even the tiniest indication that wearing masks reduces cases. Let’s observe a few areas around the world, courtesy of rationalground.com, to see just how effective mask wearing has been 


- "Sweden was a failure"
        - I recommend extreme caution when talking about Sweden. Noting the phenomenal success of Sweden’s “battle” with Covid-19 will likely invoke hissing more unbearable than a vampire being pressed with a silver crucifix in broad daylight. 
        - Most attempts at rebutting Sweden’s success start with mentioning Sweden’s high death rate. Yes, their death rate was high, but this was due to a poor management of nursing homes. Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren admitted (https://news.yahoo.com/sweden-admits-failure-protect-elderly-care-homes-024202762.html) that Sweden failed to protect their elderly. As of April 28, 90 percent of those who died from Covid-19 were over 70 years old. Half of these deaths occurred in nursing homes and another quarter occurred during at-home care

- Closing:
    - The vast majority of the population is now okay with sitting at home and watching TV to figure out what their governors and local officials are going to allow them to do for the day.
