The assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the chief of Iran's Quds Force, was sold to the American public as a necessary deterrent for future Iranian attacks against United States personnel stationed in the Middle East. To no surprise, Conservative Inc. and other regime-loving interventionists were quick to defend this stance on social media. And I guess the whole Trump-was-just-trying-to-prevent-a-war line of reasoning made sense, but only if you were so short-sighted as to believe that history began when Iran, out of its deep hatred for bikinis and fully stocked grocery stores, suddenly decided to attack a U.S. base in Iraq, killing an American contractor in the process. 

A honest view of the situation requires a look at the whole [timeline](https://original.antiwar.com/danny_sjursen/2020/01/05/who-started-it-litigious-a-reverse-timeline-of-us-iran-retaliations/) of U.S. and Iranian conflict. You will find, indisputaby, that the United States was the primary aggressor in the region as early as the 1950s. This aggression inflamed to much greater heights during the Bush and Obama administrations and is now being dutifully preserved by the unilateral decision-making of Donald Trump. 

Not even a week went by since Soleimani's assassination before the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps responded with missile strike on a U.S base in western Iraq . . . some deterrent that assassination was. Thankfully, the United States and Iran [appear to be de-escalating](https://news.antiwar.com/2020/01/07/tweets-suggest-us-iran-conflict-deescalating-after-tuesdays-attacks/) as Trump and Iranian foreign minster Javad Zarif indicated on Twitter.
