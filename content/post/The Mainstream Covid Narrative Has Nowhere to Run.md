- don't hear much about gender wage gap since it has been so thoroughly debunked over public airwaves/debates/interviews. Back then, proponents of the gender wage gap actually had to make their case against those with whom they disagreed. Lively debates and [fiery interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54) eventually led to the collapse of the mainstream narrative that the gender wage gap was due solely to our nation's oppressive patriarchy. It became clear&mdash;not overnight, but through a continued dismantaling of the mainstream narrative&;mdashthat the gender wage gap was due to a variety of voluntary decisions made on behalf of women.
- However, when it comes to the "discussion" around Covid-19, propagators of the establishmet-approved narrative find their voices echoed across all major media airwaves and social media platforms, shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies.

Now, despite numbers that are currently worse than the first half of 2020, governors are suddenly pushing for the reopening of their economies and easing restrictions on gathering sizes. In particular, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy [recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1356998994006794243?s=20) that on Feburary 5, gyms and restaurants can increase capacity to 35% while indoor performance venues and indoor gatherings for activities such as weddings or political events can host up to 150 people. This announcement comes at a time when New Jersey has [higher](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/new-jersey) case counts, deaths, and hospitalizations than it did during the entire stretch from June to October, where more severe restrictions were in place. Responses to Murphy's tweet, as with other governors' announcements of plans to ease restrictions, are generally negative and indicative of a covid-panicked population that prefers to remain under their safety blanket of social regulations.

To those following the official narrative, the mask confers the social status of "good person" upon its wearer, while those who say masks aren't doing anything to get Covid under control are considered soulless
