# INTRO

A few years ago, the gender wage gap was a popular and often heated topic of discussion. On one side of the debate were those who believed that the gender wage gap was the result of an oppressive patriarchy. On the other side of the discussion were those who believed that different ambitions, personality traits, and voluntary decisions of men and women explained the gap. Back then, intellectuals on both sides made their case, often publicly, against those with whom they disagreed. Through years of rigorous discussions, lively debates, uncensored article posts, and [fiery interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54), the idea that women's earnings had anything to do with "the patriarchy" had been so thoroughly debunked that all discussion around it has ceased. 

Dismantling the approved Covid-19 narrative&mdash;mask mandates and lockdowns being effective virus mitigation strategies&mdash;appears to be a more formidable challenge. Today, propagators of the approved Covid-19 narrative have enjoyed the benefit of knowing their voices are unanimously echoed and will flow uncesnored across all major news outlets and social media platforms, shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies that have neither scientific nor historical precedent. The result is a seemingly unalterable, media-induced cultural divide between those who approve of the official Covid-19 narrative and those who see mask mandates and lockdowns as ineffective and, in the case of lockdowns, a disproportionately deadly strategy. 

## 

The problem with accepting that the Covid-19 narrative is unalterable is that there is simply too much data to come to any other conclusion than mask mandates and lockdowns being incredibly ineffective virus mitigation strategies, and this data must continue to be pushed. There is the recent [study](https://www.newsweek.com/covid-lockdowns-have-no-clear-benefit-vs-other-voluntary-measures-international-study-shows-1561656) published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation showing no clear benefit to state-imposed lockdowns as opposed to other voluntary measures; I've written in the past [demonstrating](https://mises.org/wire/theres-still-no-evidence-either-lockdowns-or-masks-are-game-changers) the ineffectiveness of mask mandates and lockdowns through a plethora of data visualizations; and we know of the disproportionately deadly [costs](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) associated with lockdowns. 

But there are two visualizations in particular, courtesy of [Hold2](https://twitter.com/Hold2llc), that lay the official Covid-19 narrative to rest:

But there remains hope for the tides to turn. Despite numbers that are worse than the first half of 2020, governors are starting to push for the reopening of their economies and the easing of restrictions on gathering sizes. In particular, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy [recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1356998994006794243?s=20) that on Feburary 5, gyms and restaurants can increase capacity to 35% while indoor performance venues and indoor gatherings for activities such as weddings or political events can host up to 150 people. This announcement comes at a time when New Jersey has [higher](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/new-jersey) case counts, deaths, and hospitalizations than it did during the entire stretch from June to October, where more severe restrictions were in place. 

Responses to Murphy's tweet, as with other governors' announcements of plans to ease restrictions, are generally negative and indicative of a covid-panicked population that prefers to remain under their safety blanket of social regulations that have been in place for almost an entire year.
