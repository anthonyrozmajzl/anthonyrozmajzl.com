# INTRO

A few years ago, the gender wage gap was a popular and often heated topic of discussion. On one side of the debate were those who believed that the gender wage gap was the result of an oppressive patriarchy. On the other side of the discussion were those who believed that different ambitions, personality traits, and voluntary decisions of men and women explained the gap. Back then, intellectuals on both sides made their case, often publicly, against those with whom they disagreed. Eventually, through rigorous discussions, lively debates, uncensored article posts, and [fiery interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54), the idea that women's earnings had anything to do with "the patriarchy" had been so thoroughly debunked that all discussion around it has ceased. 

Dismantling the approved Covid-19 narrative&mdash;mask mandates and lockdowns being effective virus mitigation strategies&mdash;appears to be a more formiddable challenge. Propagators of the approved Covid-19 narrative enjoy the benefits of censorship immunity and having their voices echoed across all major news outlets and social media platforms. They are shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies with neither scientific nor historical precedent. Those who see mask mandates and lockdowns as ineffective and, in the case of lockdowns, a disproportionately deadly strategy, do not enjoy these same benefits. These same people find themselves forced to wear masks primarily to avoid fines, public ridicule, or simply to placate the emotions of those who cannot stand the sight of a stranger's maskless face. The media have thoroughly embedded in the minds of the American people the idea that the masked individual is the good and caring person, while the unmasked individual the selfish, negligent, punishable, science-denier. This seemingly unalterable narrative rests on the critical assumption that mask mandates and lockdowns are effective tools for virus mitigation.

## Death By Data

The problem with accepting that the current Covid-19 narrative is unalterable is that there is far too much data to come to any other conclusion than mask mandates and lockdowns being incredibly ineffective virus mitigation strategies. This data must continue to be pushed as it becomes available. 

A couple months ago, the author had [demonstrated](https://mises.org/wire/theres-still-no-evidence-either-lockdowns-or-masks-are-game-changers) the ineffectiveness of mask mandates and lockdowns using a plethora of data visualizations. Additionaly, you can read [30 studies](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/), including the recent [study](https://www.newsweek.com/covid-lockdowns-have-no-clear-benefit-vs-other-voluntary-measures-international-study-shows-1561656) published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation, all showing no clear benefit to state-imposed lockdowns as virus mitigation strategies. We also know of the disproportionately deadly [costs](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) associated with lockdowns and can point to numerous visualizations highlighting the utter futility of both mask mandates and lockdowns. But there is one visualization in particular, courtesy of [Hold2](https://twitter.com/Hold2llc), that lays the official Covid-19 narrative to rest. It compares hospitalizations and deaths in Flordia with those in New York and California, both highly touted examples of having "followed the science."

How is possible that Florida, a popular travel destination with one of the oldest populations in the country that has been fully open since September, currently has lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California, a state with heavy restrictions and one of the youngest populations in the country? The establishment-approved science simply cannot answer this question. Yes, overall California does slightly better than Florida in deaths per million, but this can be explained away largely in part by the vast age discrepancy which heavily favors youthful California. Florida has zero restrictions on bars, breweries, indoor dining, gyms, places of worship, gathering sizes, and almost all schools are offering in-person instruction. On the other hand, California and New York still retain [heavy restrictions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUGlYbXUAcyNrK?format=jpg&name=large) in all of these areas and have much stronger social pressure to mask up. At the *very* least, Florida's hospitalizations and deaths per million should be phenomenally worse than California's and New York's. Those who predicted death and destruction as a consequence of Flordia's September reopening simply cannot see these results as anything other than utterly remarkable. 

Invariably, this graph will invoke responses pointing to Californians' and New Yorkers' supposed lack of compliance. Relative to Florida, this claim is patently absurd on its face given the fact that Florida has been fully open since mid-September. Are individuals sincerely trying to claim that Florida's numbers are lower because they're doing a better job complying with mask mandates and social regulations? Certainly nobody believes this. Floridians are demonized on a daily basis as selfish, anti-science hicks who deserve what's supposedly coming to them. Reactions to a recent [video](https://twitter.com/SamBrockNBC/status/1357047400548950023?s=20) of a maskless supermarket in Collier County, Florida, which has been viewed millions of times, are highly indicative of the steretoype surrounding Florida's purportedly backwards, non-compliant citizenry. 

Let's take a look at a few indicators that would tell us how heavily Floridians and Californians are compliying with measures that supposedly help reduce covid-19 transmission. The following survey data is taken from Carnegie Mellon University's [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210201&region=FL). To the right of the red vertical line in each of the following graphs is roughly the time when Florida had consistently lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California. 

#### Mask Compliance

#### Traveling

#### Restaurant Visits

As you can see, the whole non-compliance schtick appears to be nothing more than a convenient excuse to explain away undesirable trends. Californians, realtive to Floridians, have consistently been doing a much better job of avoiding social behaviors that allegedly fuel the spread of covid-19. Are we supposed to believe that prior to November 5, when California had *lower* hopitalizations and deaths per million than Florida, that Californians were doing a great job complying? Then, less than two months later, Californians unanimously stopped complying as Florida overtook them in both metrics? This ridiculously dubious claim is at direct odds with the behavioral patterns shown above. 

If we move away from the Flordia-California comparison, on the national level there still remains zero correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and deaths per million.

In fact, if we visualize the trend in cases across all fifty states, each with varying levels of restrictions, you'll quickly notice the pattern that most states seem to follow

We can even take a look at counties within particular states&mdash;removing the climate/seasonality discrepancy&mdash;to see whether or not mask mandates have had any noticeable impact on cases. Circling back to the supermarket video from Collier County, FL, it would be suspected, according to the mainstream narrative, that this defiant county is raking in deaths faster than they can count them. Below is graph comparing deaths in science-denying Collier County, FL to science-following Imperial County, CA, which has had a mask mandate since April.

We can even compare Collier County, FL to its neighboring county of Charlotte, which has had a mask mandate since late July.

Lastly, we can look on a national level to see the wonderful effects of mask mandates. Prepare yourself, dear reader, the following is intended for mature audiences only.

Not surprisingly, whether or not counties or states mandate masks at different times, for different periods of time, or mandate them at all has no bearing on the path the virus takes. Invariably, an attempt will be made, with no hint of sarcasm, to claim that states and counties with bad outcomes can chalk those bad outcomes up to a lack of compliance, a convenient excuse for explaining away any undesirable trend that appears in a state or county that was heralded as having "followed the science." But if compliance can't be achieved with a mask mandate, then why does the mandate exist? Do proponents of mask mandates simply believe that they are better than no mandate at all and would, on average, create enough social pressure to induce at least *some* increased level of mask-wearing? If so, what can they make of the county-level charts showing no discernable difference&mdash;often times, non-mask wearing counties have better results than mask-wearing counties&mdash; between mask-wearing and non-mask-wearing counties? 

Instead of recognizing the futility of these mandates, a vast majority of people prefer to remain wrapped in a security blanket of social regulations that confer upon the swaddled a sense of safety and moral superiority.

Finish with dailymail article (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9219379/Why-coronavirus-cases-falling-fast-New-infections-drop-44-three-weeks.html) and mention responses to Phil Murphy's tweet.....people prefer the feeling of control and safety that comes with remaining wrapped up in a safety blanket of social regulations.
