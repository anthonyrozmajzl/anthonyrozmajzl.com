# INTRO

A few years ago, the gender wage gap was a popular and often heated topic of discussion. On one side of the debate were those who believed that the gender wage gap was the result of an oppressive patriarchy. On the other side of the discussion were those who believed that different ambitions, personality traits, and voluntary decisions of men and women explained the gap. Back then, intellectuals on both sides made their case, often publicly, against those with whom they disagreed. Eventually, through rigorous discussions, lively debates, uncensored article posts, and [fiery interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54), the idea that women's earnings had anything to do with "the patriarchy" had been so thoroughly debunked that all discussion around it has ceased. 

Today, dismantling the approved Covid-19 narrative&mdash;mask mandates and lockdowns being effective virus mitigation strategies&mdash;appears to be a more formiddable challenge. Propagators of the approved Covid-19 narrative have enjoyed the benefit of knowing their voices are unanimously echoed and will flow uncesnored across all major news outlets and social media platforms, shielded from the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies that have neither scientific nor historical precedent. The result is a seemingly unalterable, news and social media-induced cultural divide between those who approve of the official Covid-19 narrative and those who see mask mandates and lockdowns as ineffective and, in the case of lockdowns, a disproportionately deadly strategy. 

## Death By Data

The problem with accepting that the Covid-19 narrative is unalterable is that there is simply too much data to come to any other conclusion than mask mandates and lockdowns being incredibly ineffective virus mitigation strategies, and this data must continue to be pushed as it becomes available. There is the recent [study](https://www.newsweek.com/covid-lockdowns-have-no-clear-benefit-vs-other-voluntary-measures-international-study-shows-1561656) published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation showing no clear benefit to state-imposed lockdowns as opposed to other voluntary measures; the author has previously [demonstrated](https://mises.org/wire/theres-still-no-evidence-either-lockdowns-or-masks-are-game-changers) the ineffectiveness of mask mandates and lockdowns through a plethora of data visualizations; and we know of the disproportionately deadly [costs](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) associated with lockdowns. 

But there is one visualization in particular, courtesy of [Hold2](https://twitter.com/Hold2llc), that lays the official Covid-19 narrative to rest. It compares hospitalizations and deaths in Flordia with those in New York and California, both perfect examples of states that "followed the science." The results unsurprisingly run completely contrary to the mainstream narrative.

How is it even remotely possible for Florida, a popular travel destination with one of the oldest populations in the country and no travel restrictions, to outperform California, with one of the youngest populations in the country, in current hospitalizations and deaths per million? The establishment-approved science simply cannot answer this question. Yes, over all California does slightly better than Florida in deaths per million, but this can be explained away be the vast age discrepancy which heavily favors youthful California. Florida has zero restrictions on bars, breweries, indoor dining, gyms, places of worship, gathering sizes, and almost all schools are offering in-person instruction. On the other hand, California and New York still retain [heavy restrictions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUGlYbXUAcyNrK?format=jpg&name=large) in these areas and have much stronger social pressure to mask up. At the *very* least, Florida's hospitalizations and deaths per million should be phenomenally worse than California's. Those who predicted death and destruction as a consequence of Flordia's September reopening simply cannot see these results as anything other than utterly remarkable. 

Invariably, an attempt will always be made, with no hint of sarcasm, to claim that California's results are due to a lack of compliance. The whole compliance schtick rears its head whenever an undesirable trend appears in a state or county that was "following the science."

On a national level, there still remains zero correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and deaths per million.

In fact, if we visualize the trend in cases across all fifty states, all with varying levels of restrictions, a pattern quickly presents itself that justfies the precedeing graph.

We can even take a look at counties within particular states to see whether or not mask mandates have had any noticeable impact on cases. I'll leave it to the reader to guess whether or not we will see any meaningful correlation.

Not surprisingly, whether or not counties or states mandate masks at different times, for different periods of time, or mandate them at all has no bearing on the path the virus takes. Instead of recognizing the futility of these mandates, a vast majority of people prefer to remain wrapped in a security blanket of social regulations that confer upon the swaddled a sense of safety and moral superiority.

If you want evidence of the national psychosis surrounding masks, take a look at some of the responses to the following video of a maskless supermarket in Florida:


Responses to Murphy's tweet, as with other governors' announcements of plans to ease restrictions, are generally negative and indicative of a covid-panicked population that prefers to remain under their safety blanket of social regulations that have been in place for almost an entire year.
