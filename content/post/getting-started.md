I have an economics degree from, in my opinion, the best undergraduate economics program in the country. At [Grove City College](https://www.gcc.edu), economics is taught primarily from the perspective of *The Austrian School*.  The Austrian School of Economics is distinctive in that it applies the methodology of [praxeology](https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics), starting with the axiom of human action, to the study economics.  It has its roots in the thoughts of great Austrian economists including Carl Menger, Eugen BÃ¶hm von Bawerk, Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises and has been carried on in the United States, most notably by Murray Rothbard.  The epicenter of Austrian Economics is in Auburn, Alabama at the [Ludwig von Mises Institute](https://mises.org) - a place I would highly recommend visiting online.

Beyond economics, my rigorous and classical course of study at Grove City prepared me in innumerable ways for life in the world.  However, as I've been beating the streets for an analyst position, it's become clear that proven quantitative analysis skills and data analytics experience are "table stakes" at most companies.  R, Python, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Jupyter Notebooks, and on and on... This is a gap for me.

Now, I would definitely say that I'm an analytical person, and totally at ease with complex mathematics and statistical concepts.  And I love a challenge. That's why I've jumped head-first into DataCamp's *Data Scientist with Python* career track. I'm not quite halfway into the course and am blown away by everything I have learned in so little time.  The instructors are fantastic, the exercises/projects are based on real-world problems, and the coursework encompasses everything a Python Data Scientist would need to know, or at least be familiar with. You will cover topics like basic and intermediate Python, data manipluation/cleaning in Python, Pandas, SQL, Databases, Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, and Neural Networks. Not to mention, DataCamp also offers this same career track for R programmers. Anyone who is looking to break into the realm of data analysis should seriously consider DataCamp as their learning platform.

I am definitely on my way toward a rewarding and exciting career in data science/analytics and can't wait to chew through the remaining coursework. I plan to share my experiences here - hopefully with some interesting examples.
