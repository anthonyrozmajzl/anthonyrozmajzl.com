Dismantling the approved Covid-19 narrative, that behavioral mandates and lockdowns have been effective virus mitigation strategies, has proven to be a formidable challenge. Propagators of this narrative have enjoyed total censorship immunity across all major news outlets and social media platforms, and have altogether avoided the burden of proof that naturally arises from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies. This has enabled the media to push the narrative that the masked individual is the good and caring person, while the unmasked individual is a selfish science-denier, worthy of punishment and ostracization. This seemingly unalterable narrative rests, of course, on the critical assumption that behavioral mandates and lockdowns protect us from covid-19.  

## One Chart to Rule Them All

In terms of lockdowns, we now have [30 studies](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/) showing no clear benefit to their imposition, as well as extensive knowledge regarding their [disproportionately deadly costs](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/). Thanks to this data, it appears that discussions surrounding the reintroudction of nationwide lockdowns have all but ceased.

As far as dismantling the argument in favor of behavioral mandates such as curfews, capacity restrictions, mask mandates, and others, there is one visualization the reader should be highly familiar with. This visualization shows a shocking comparison of hospitalizations and deaths per million in Florida with those in New York and California, the latter two states being highly touted examples of states that had "followed the science." The establishment-friendly covid narrative simply has no explanation for what follows. For the remainder of this article we will be focusing solely on the comparison between Florida and California.

![FL vs Others](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtotegIXIBM6ALs?format=jpg&name=large)

In light of everything our officials have taught us about this virus spreads, how is it possible that Florida, a fully open and popular travel destination with one of the oldest populations in the country, currently has lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California, a state with much heavier restrictions and one of the youngest populations in the country? The establishment-approved science simply cannot answer this question. While it is true that, overall, California does slightly better than Florida in deaths per million, this can be explained away largely in part by the vast age discrepancy which heavily favors youthful California. 

Moreover, Florida has zero restrictions on bars, breweries, indoor dining, gyms, places of worship, gathering sizes, and almost all schools are offering in-person instruction. California, on the other hand, still retains [heavy restrictions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUGlYbXUAcyNrK?format=jpg&name=large) in all of these areas. At the *very* least, Florida's hospitalizations and deaths per million should be phenomenally worse than California's. Those who predicted death and destruction as a consequence of Flordia's September reopening simply cannot see these results as anything other than utterly remarkable. 

## Does Compliance Explain the Discrepancy?

Invariably, the above graph will invoke responses pointing to Californians supposed lack of compliance as justification for their dismal numbers. Relative to Florida, this claim is patently absurd on its face given the fact that Florida has been fully open since September. Does anybody sincerely believe that Florida's numbers are lower because their citizens are behaving moreso according to CDC guidleines than Californians? Certainly not. Floridians are consistently demonized as selfish science-deniers who fully deserve every death coming their way. A quick glance at the reactions to a [recent video](https://twitter.com/SamBrockNBC/status/1357047400548950023?s=20) of a maskless supermarket in Collier County, Florida should be enough to convince you of the general animosity held by most towards Floridian culture amidst the pandemic. 

However, there are a few relevant metrics that would shed some light on just how frequently Floridians and Californians are engaging behaviors that supposedly fuel covid-19 transmission. The following survey data&mdash;California is shown in blue, Florida in gray&mdash;is taken from Carnegie Mellon University's [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210201&region=FL). The red vertical line is the point at which Florida had lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California. 

##### Mask Compliance

##### Bar Vists

##### Traveling

![Away Locations FL vs CA](/images/AwayLocationsFLvsCA.png)

##### Restaurant Visits

![Restaurant Visits Fl vs CA](/images/RestaurantVistsFLvsCA.png)

We can see that, relative to Floridians, Californians have consistently been doing a better job of avoiding social behaviors that allegedly fuel the spread of covid-19, but with no results to show for it. At no point in these charts was there an apparent change in behavior after December 17 indicating that Floridians had suddenly started to avoid the behaviors supposedly linked to covid transmission.

Additionally, a quick glance at each state's ["social distancing score"](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) indicates, yet again, that Californians have been doing a better job avoiding activities meant to facilitate the spread of covid-19. Finally, Google's [covid mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) as of February 2, 2021, show that Californians have fewer retail and recreational visits&mdash;restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters&mdash; as well as fewer grocery store and pharmacy visits, which include farmers markets, food warehouses, and speciality food shops. Clearly, the whole non-compliance schtick is a fraudulent excuse for explaining away undesirable trends. 

Lastly, are we expected to believe that prior to November 5, when California had lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than Florida, that Californians were more serious about the virus? Then, less than two months later, Californians suddenly stopped caring as they fell behind Florida in both metrics? This incredibly dubious claim is at direct odds with behavioral patterns depicted above

## More Metrics Rebutting the Mainstream Covid-19 Narrative

Moving away briefly from the Florida-California comparison, national metrics also highlight the lack of correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and deaths per million.

![50 States Restriction vs Deaths Per Million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqf4ZzjW4AAtgwQ?format=jpg&name=900x900)

In fact, if we visualize case trends across all fifty states, each state having varying levels of restrictions, you'll quickly notice a pattern that presents itself quite similarly across all fifty states: a bump in cases early in the year followed by a much bigger surge in cases during winter months. 

![50 State Case Trends](/images/Case_Trend_All_50_States.png)

Nearly identical case patterns across fifty states is hardly an indicator of a government capable of influencing the course of the virus. Rather, it appears that a simple changing of seasons, or "seasonality," is the key variable affecting case patterns. [Research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in *Evolutionary Bioinformatics* also shows that case counts and mortality rates are strongly correlated with temperature and latitude, again reinforcing the claim that legislation is futile in the battle with covid-19. Once seasonality is recognized, it is very likely that we will start speaking of "covid season" in the same way we speak of "flu season." A helpful visual of what covid season might look like can be found [here](https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1358658394564009985?s=21).

Circling back to Collier County, FL, home of the infamous maskless supermarket, it would be suspected, according to the mainstream narrative, that this defiant county is experiencing deaths on a massive scale. Let's compare deaths in science-denying Collier County to science-following Imperial County, CA, which has had a mask mandate since April, the earliest in the country.

![Collier, FL vs Imperial County, CA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtWicZrVgAMRrTI?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

We can even look at similar regions&mdash;removing the climate/seasonality discrepancy&mdash;to see whether or not varying degrees of behavioral mandates have had any noticeable impact on cases. What youâ€™ll find, yet again, is that regardless of the timing or existence of mask mandates and other behavioral mandates, similar regions follow the same case growth patterns, again supporting the notion of seasonality.

![Collier, FL vs Charlotte, FL](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtaYwP-UcAACDpW?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

![Southern CA Counties](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtvCJl_VcAMq7jx?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

![DC Metro](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtsFhImVkAQYFhA?format=jpg&name=large)

It is quite strange that different cities and counties of similar regions, all with varying timings and degrees of covid restrictions, just happened to follow nearly identical case patterns. It is exceedingly misleading for government officials and their health experts to suggest that politically charged behavioral mandates could alter these patterns. The data simply do not support this idea. .  

## Update on the Holiday Surge and Alabama Superspreader

Some of you may be wondering what happened to the "holiday surge" that was supposed to be ravaging our hospitals right about now. Well, it never happened. Not only did the rate of covid-19 hospitalization growth decline after Thanksgiving, hospitalizations peaked less than two weeks after Christmas and have been sharply plummeting since! We at least should have seen a rapid increase in the hospitalization growth rate after Christmas. 

![The "Holiday Surge"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtV5wO2VkAAq_cO?format=jpg&name=medium)

Finally, as a bonus for those who like to keep up to date with the latest installment of The Media Who Cried Superspreader, Alabama recently came under heavy fire after [thousands of maskless football fans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tuscaloosa-celebration-alabama-national-championship-covid-19-concerns/) took to the streets to celebrate their team winning the national college football title. Fansided was [quick to label](https://fansided.com/2021/01/12/alabama-football-fans-defy-covid-guidelines-super-spreader-celebration-strip-videos/) the large celebration as a superspreader event, and health officials were [worried](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/health-officials-worry-alabama-football-celebration-was-superspreader-event.html) that the Alabama superspreader was going to result in a huge case spike. Here's what really happened.

![Alabama vs Missisippi Nat'l Championship](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etkd1TBVgAEuAor?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Miraculously, cases immediately plummeted after the "superspreader" event and continue to plummet to this day. If that wasn't enough, Mississippi, Alabama's next-door neighbor, followed a nearly identical case pattern despite hosting no superspreader events. But don't hold your breath for any sort of apology from the health officials or media outlets that predicted doom and gloom for Alabama. 

## Conclusion

[Recent data](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9219379/Why-coronavirus-cases-falling-fast-New-infections-drop-44-three-weeks.html) show that in the past few weeks, cases have fallen 45% in the United States, 30% globally, and hospitalizations have dropped 26% since their mid-January peak. Yet there appears to be a general confusion as to how we've achieved these numbers. Did populations around the world unanimously begin complying with covid regulations? Did governments finally get serious about enforcing their mandates? Those are some explanations we might hear, but only so long as cases and hospitalizations continue to trend downwards. 

It is very unlikely, however, that health officials will start pointing to seasonality as the most rational explanation for the year's worth of data showing very similar case trends across fifty diverse states. Accepting this reality would mean that nearly a year's worth of heavily politicized behavioral mandates, life-destroying lockdowns, and devastating business closures were all for naught. Fortunately, there is far too much data to avoid coming to any other conclusion. At some point we must accept that attempting to socially engineer a respiratory virus out of existence is nothing short of a fool's errand.
