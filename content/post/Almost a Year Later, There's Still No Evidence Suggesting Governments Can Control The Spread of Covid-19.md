As we approach the one-year anniversary of "fifteen days to slow the spread," we have yet to acquire any data suggesting that the past year of life-destroying lockdowns and politicized behavioral mandates has done anything to keep us safe from covid-19. While discussions surrounding the reintroduction of nationwide lockdowns seem to have ceased&mdash;it's impossible to ignore the lockdowns' [disproportionately deadly effects](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/) and the [numerous studies](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/) demonstrating their futility&mdash;the media still retain their grip on the narrative that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandates, curfews, capacity restrictions, gathering restrictions, and others remain necessary to prevail in our fight with covid-19. 

Government officials, in lockstep with big tech and nearly all major news outlets, have controlled this narrative to such an extent that its proponents have simply sidestepped the burden of proof naturally arising from the introduction and continued support of novel virus mitigation strategies, happily pointing to the fact that their ideas enjoy unanimous support from the media and government officials all over the world. This seemingly impenetrable narrative rests, of course, on the critical assumption that NPIs, or behavioral mandates, have protected us from covid-19. Fortunately, there is just too much data for this narrative to last.

## One Chart to Rule Them All

If there is one visualization the reader should become familiar with to understand the ineffectiveness of NPIs, it would be the following chart comparing hospitalizations and deaths per million in Florida with those in New York and California, however we will be focusing solely on the comparison between Florida and California, the latter often being touted as an example of a state that "followed the science."

![FL vs Others](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Et4h_3mXUAMpcu3?format=jpg&name=large)

In light of everything our officials have taught us about how this virus spreads, how is it possible that Florida, a fully open and popular travel destination with one of the oldest populations in the country, currently has lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California, a state with much heavier restrictions and one of the youngest populations in the country? The establishment-approved science simply cannot answer this question.  It is true that, overall, California does slightly better than Florida in deaths per million, but even this is [accounted for](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Et4iEGKXIAgpu2S?format=jpg&name=large) after adjusting for California’s much younger population.

Florida has zero restrictions on bars, breweries, indoor dining, gyms, places of worship, gathering sizes, and almost all schools are offering in-person instruction. California, on the other hand, still retains [heavy restrictions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Et4iIg5XUAY6od-?format=jpg&name=large) in each of these areas. At the *very* least, Florida's hospitalizations and deaths per million should be substantially worse than California's. Those who predicted death and destruction as a consequence of Flordia's September reopening simply cannot see these results as anything other than utterly remarkable. 

## Does Compliance Explain the Discrepancy?

Invariably, the above graph will invoke responses pointing to Californians supposed lack of compliance relative to Floridians as justification for their poor numbers. On its face, this claim is patently absurd given that Florida has been fully open since September. But if we dig into the data a bit more, we find some relevant metrics that shed light on how frequently Floridians and Californians engage in behaviors that supposedly fuel covid-19 transmission. The following survey data--California is shown in blue, Florida in gray--is taken from Carnegie Mellon University's [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210201&region=FL). The red vertical line is the point at which Florida had lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than California. 

##### Mask Compliance

##### Traveling

![Away Locations FL vs CA](/images/AwayLocationsFLvsCA.png)

##### Restaurant Visits

![Restaurant Visits Fl vs CA](/images/RestaurantVistsFLvsCA.png)

We can see that, relative to Floridians, Californians have consistently been doing a better job of avoiding social behaviors that allegedly fuel the spread of covid-19, but with no results to show for it. At no point in these charts was there an apparent change in behavior after December 17 indicating that Floridians had suddenly started to avoid the behaviors supposedly linked to covid transmission.

Additionally, a quick glance at each state's ["social distancing score"](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) indicates, yet again, that Californians have been doing a better job avoiding activities meant to facilitate the spread of covid-19. Finally, Google's [covid mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) as of February 2, 2021, show that Californians have fewer retail and recreational visits&mdash;restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters&mdash; as well as fewer grocery store and pharmacy visits, which include farmers markets, food warehouses, and speciality food shops. Clearly, the whole non-compliance schtick is a fraudulent excuse for explaining away undesirable trends. 

Lastly, are we expected to believe that prior to November 5, when California had lower hospitalizations and deaths per million than Florida, that Californians were more serious about the virus? Then, less than two months later, Californians suddenly stopped caring as they fell behind Florida in both metrics? This incredibly dubious claim is at direct odds with behavioral patterns depicted above

## More Metrics Rebutting the Mainstream Covid-19 Narrative

Moving away briefly from the Florida-California comparison, national metrics also highlight the lack of correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and deaths per million.

![50 States Restriction vs Deaths Per Million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqf4ZzjW4AAtgwQ?format=jpg&name=900x900)

In fact, if we visualize case trends across all fifty states, each state having varying levels of restrictions, you'll quickly notice a pattern that presents itself quite similarly across all fifty states: a bump in cases early in the year followed by a much bigger surge in cases during winter months. 

![50 State Case Trends](/images/Case_Trend_All_50_States.png)

Nearly identical case patterns across fifty states is hardly an indicator of a government capable of influencing the course of the virus. Instead, [research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in Evolutionary Bioinformatics shows that case counts and mortality rates are strongly correlated with temperature and latitude. This is the concept known as “seasonality,” which, once recognized, largely explains the failure of the past year's NPIs. 

After recognizing seasonality as one of the driving factors behind case fluctuations, it is very likely that we will start speaking of "covid season" as pragmatically and cautiously as we speak of "flu season." A helpful visual of what covid season might look like can be found [here](https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1358658394564009985?s=21). 

Meanwhile, we can look at seasonally congruent regions to see whether or not varying degrees of behavioral mandates have had any noticeable impact on cases. What we find, thanks to seasonality, is that regardless of the timing or existence of mask mandates and other behavioral mandates, similar regions tend to follow similar case growth patterns.

For the firm believer in NPIs, these simultaneous and nearly identical fluctuations are inexplicable. More specific seasonality visualizations, which compare regions to their expected latitudinal patterns, can be found [here](https://twitter.com/Hold2LLC/media)

Now let’s briefly turn our attention to Collier County, Florida, home of the infamous [maskless supermarket](https://twitter.com/SamBrockNBC/status/1357047400548950023?s=20). It would be suspected, according to the mainstream narrative, that this defiant county is experiencing deaths on a massive scale. However, if we compare deaths per million in science-denying Collier County with those in Imperial County, CA, which had the earliest mask mandate in the country, we find, predictably, another hole in the mainstream narrative.

## Update on the Holiday Surge and Alabama Superspreader

Some of you may be wondering what happened to the "holiday surge" that was supposed to be ravaging our hospitals right about now. Well, it never happened. Not only did the rate of covid-19 hospitalization growth decline after Thanksgiving, hospitalizations peaked less than two weeks after Christmas and have been sharply plummeting since! We at least should have seen a rapid increase in the hospitalization growth rate after Christmas. 

![The "Holiday Surge"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtV5wO2VkAAq_cO?format=jpg&name=medium)

Finally, as a bonus for those who like to keep up to date with the latest installment of The Media Who Cried Superspreader, Alabama recently came under heavy fire after [thousands of maskless football fans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tuscaloosa-celebration-alabama-national-championship-covid-19-concerns/) took to the streets to celebrate their team winning the national college football title. Fansided was [quick to label](https://fansided.com/2021/01/12/alabama-football-fans-defy-covid-guidelines-super-spreader-celebration-strip-videos/) the large celebration as a superspreader event, and health officials were [worried](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/health-officials-worry-alabama-football-celebration-was-superspreader-event.html) that the Alabama superspreader was going to result in a huge case spike. Here's what really happened.

![Alabama vs Missisippi Nat'l Championship](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etkd1TBVgAEuAor?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Miraculously, cases immediately plummeted after the "superspreader" event and continue to plummet to this day. If that wasn't enough, Mississippi, Alabama's next-door neighbor, followed a nearly identical case pattern despite hosting no superspreader events. But don't hold your breath for any sort of apology from the health officials or media outlets that predicted doom and gloom for Alabama. 

## Conclusion

[Recent data](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9219379/Why-coronavirus-cases-falling-fast-New-infections-drop-44-three-weeks.html) show that in the past few weeks, cases have fallen 45% in the United States, 30% globally, and hospitalizations have dropped 26% since their mid-January peak. Yet there appears to be a general confusion as to how we've achieved these numbers. Did populations around the world unanimously begin complying with covid regulations? Did governments finally get serious about enforcing their mandates? Those are some explanations we might hear, but only so long as cases and hospitalizations continue to trend downwards. 

It is very unlikely, however, that health officials will start pointing to seasonality as the most rational explanation for the year's worth of data showing very similar case trends across fifty diverse states. Accepting this reality would mean that nearly a year's worth of heavily politicized behavioral mandates, life-destroying lockdowns, and devastating business closures were all for naught. Fortunately, there is far too much data to avoid coming to any other conclusion. At some point we must accept that attempting to socially engineer a respiratory virus out of existence is nothing short of a fool's errand.
