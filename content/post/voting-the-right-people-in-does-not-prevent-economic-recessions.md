To combat the negative economic shocks associated with COVID-19, the Federal Reserve has announced a (series of economic stimuli) [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fed-unveils-emergency-action-effort-to-support-economy-from-coronavirus-130608] that are designed to support the economy during this time of intense instability. These measures include at *least* $700 billion in stimulus through the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage-back securities, a lowering of the (federal funds rate)[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS] to between 0.0 and 0.25 percent, and, effective March 26, a (lowering of bank reserve requirements to 0 percent)[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm]. 

All of this is simply to say that the Federal Reserve is going to be injecting large swaths of money into the economy and will be issuing loads of cheap credit to banks. These stimulus methods are nothing new to the Federal Reserve and have long been the focus of criticsm by Austrian economists, especially when it comes to explaining the boom-bust cycle. The increase in the money supply on behalf of the Federal Reserve will only add to the gravity of the impending economic recession triggered by the COVID-19 panic. 

To understand the coming recession, we must listen to what the Austrian School of Economics has to say about the artificial infusion of money into the economy to stimulate economic activity. After all, the Austrian School of Economics has been the one school of economic thought that successfully predicted and explained the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and has been predicting another severe recession that has now been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Austrian Theory of the boom-bust/business cycle is, in my opinion, most brilliantly illustrated by Roger Garrison, professor emeritus of Economics at Auburn University and Associated Scholar of the Mises Institute.
