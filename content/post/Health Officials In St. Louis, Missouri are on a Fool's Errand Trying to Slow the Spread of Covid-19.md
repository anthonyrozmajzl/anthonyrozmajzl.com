# Health Officials In St. Louis, Missouri Still Don't Realize There's Nothing They Can Do To Slow the Spread of Covid-19

The covid-19 pandemic has served as a sober reminder for how effortlessly governments can command the unquestioned obedience of their constituents. Political actors, in conjunction with big tech and the corporate press, spent the better part of a year framing the argument for various behavioral controls such as mask mandates and business closures as the scientifically validated and morally upright position that any good, rational citizen would take in the name of preserving "public health." This line of thinking has become so thoroughly embedded in our culture that it is now widely accepted that any state, individual, or business that refuses to implement or adhere to forced business closures, mask mandates, gathering restrictions, or other behavioral mandates is de facto an science-denying enemy of public health who is fully deserving of legal punishment and public scorn.  

## The Struggle of St. Louis' Most Prominent Venues

Nobody understands this dynamic better than the owners of The Wheelhouse, a 1,000-person venue located in St. Louis, Missouri that has fallen victim to the local government's punitive health mandates. While the state of Missouri currently enjoys [no mask mandate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html), the city of St. Louis has been more than willing to ensure that The Wheelhouse, along with their two sister venues The Midwestern and Start Bar, are bending the knee to local government orders. The Wheelhouse not only commands a respectable portion of the night life in St. Louis, it is also a historical sports venue that was home to the Blues' 2019 Stanley Cup celebration, further affirming the Wheelhouse's prominence as the go-to sports venue in the city. 

Not surprisingly, there was no shortage of complaints about the continued operation of The Wheelouse, Start Bar, and The Midwestern at the beginning of the new year. As consequence, all three venues, each having been shut down twice already &mdash;The Wheelhouse and Start Bar in July and November for two weeks and The Midwestern in December and January for a month&mdash;due to violations of local covid-19 mandates, were hit with a [one year closure order](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2021/01/21/wheelhouse-start-bar-ordered-to-close-until-2022-for-covid-19-violations) by St. Louis' acting Director of Health Dr. Fredrick Echols. With financial destitution on the line for the owners and their 100+ employees, the owners were forced to accept the punitive consent order requiring them to operate at 33 percent capacity, pay for social distancing security officers to monitor their venues, and install additional video surveillance equipment that must be accessible to health inspectors and city police on demand. Since the closure notice, business revenue has fallen 70%.

## What Does The Science Have to Say? 

Echols' consent order, along with the dozens of complaints filed to local authorities on behalf of private citizens, is perfectly emblematic of the national attitude toward covid-19 mandates: comply or be treated as a menace to public health. It apparently does not matter to Echols and other local politicians what the data say about the effectiveness of mask mandates, business closures, capacity restrictions, stay-at-home orders, or any other behavioral mandate. What matters to them is that everyone fall in line and, ideally, profess an unwavering faith in the efficacy of covid-19 mandates. However, a true understanding of the data pertaining to the effectiveness of these mandates would require the immediate removal of all covid-19 restrictions, none of which have done a single thing to keep the citizens of St. Louis, Missouri safe. If this city and surrounding areas truly wish to follow the science, their officials will pay close attention to the following data.

Plain as day, despite having both a mask mandate and capacity restrictions in place at the end of summer, the city of St. Louis saw a massive explosion in cases starting in October. Invairably, the above chart will drum up the fraudulent excuse that people suddenly refuesd to comply with the mask mandate when October began. To the contrary, mask data for the city of St. Louis show that public mask compliance has consistently remained [above 90 percent since mid-September](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/?date=20210221&sensor=fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask&region=29510).

Maybe the citizens of St. Louis just all happened to stop taking the virus seriosuly as October rolled around. Well, not exactly. Mobility and social distancing metrics provided by the [University of Maryland Covid-19 Impact Analysis Platform](https://data.covid.umd.edu) show no drastic behavioral changes at the start of October, which is denoted by the red line. 

![ST LOUIS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110059260-e132bb80-7d31-11eb-8bc5-52d1721422a9.png)

To put the non-compliance narrative to rest, if you check [Google's Covid-19 mobility report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) for the city of St. Louis, you will quickly find that St. Louis residents are thoroughly outperforing the state as a whole when it comes to avoiding behaviors that supposedly fuel the spread of covid-19. Although the window of observation for this data is is smaller than preceding data, it paints a pretty clear picutre as to how much more seriously the citizens of St. Louis are taking this virus compared to the rest of the state. As is shown below, despite their exemplary behavior relative to the rest of the state, the citizens of St. Louis could not escape the October surge. In the chart that follows, Missouri's numbers appear in red.

![St  Louis vs MO as a whole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110154646-7bd2df00-7db2-11eb-86f9-a6927bedb7f0.png)

Based on an actual investigation of the data, it is abundantly clear that the political leadership in St. Louis has made no meaningful impact on cases, but instead have needlessly shut down businesses and enforced punitive mandates under the guise of preserving "public health." For local authorities to simply get away with their castigatory  and scientifically unwarranted behavior would be nothing short of criminal.

If Echols and his crew are still not convinced, data from surrounding counties might help them see that, yet again, there is no meaningful correlation between government mandates and case growth patterns.

![StLouisMetro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/109894589-c261f580-7c5b-11eb-90d5-d34df89ee894.jpeg)

For those who have been closely following state and national trends, the above chart should hardly come as a surprise. Here we have three different counties with three very different levels of restrictions, yet they all follow nearly identical case growth patterns. In July, St. Louis County introduced a mask mandate and saw worse case growth in the following month than both Jefferson County and St. Charles County, neither of which had a mask mandate in place. Almost two months later, St. Louis County attempted an "enhanced" mask mandate that again did nothing to prevent the massive case spike in mid-October. In a last-breath effort near the end of November, St. Louis County proceeded to close indoor dining while Jefferson County introduced a mask mandate; St. Charles County continued to do nothing. Miraculously, all three counties saw their cases plummet at the exact same time despite three very different levels of mitigation strategies&mdash;the jump in cases around January 8 is likely due to [holiday reporting lag](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvlnPdDXEAAbeqT?format=jpg&name=large). Note how the blatant lack of restrictions in St. Charles County had absolutely no impact on the intensity of their case growth patterns relative to St. Charles and St. Louis County, both during the surge in October and subsequent decline starting at the end of November.

Additionally, if you compare the numbers in the very first chart for the city of St. Louis against the three counties depicted above, you'll find that St. Louis' peak was roughly half that of Jefferson County and far less than both St. Louis County and St. Charles County. This is despite the city of St. Louis having both a mask mandate and capacity restrictions in place. Don't hold your breath for an explanation on this one.

Moreover, the wildly different levels of mask compliance across these three counties in early October played no bearing on the timing or intensity of the case growth rate. 

![3 counties mask compliance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/110191171-105e3100-7df5-11eb-853e-d6dc4c926c86.png)

While there seems to be a happy correlation between peak case count and mask usage, there is no good explanation as to why St. Louis County, the most restricted of the three counties with the highest level of mask compliance, had worse numbers than St. Charles County, the land of no restrictions, from mid-January through the end of February. Even more, why didn't St. Charles and Jefferson Counties, each with far worse levels of mask compliance through October than St. Louis County, experience practically identical case growth rate patterns? If the science professed to us by our health experts in the government were true, how can either of the scenarios be explained? They simply can't.

Interestingly, if we look at the covid-19 seasonality trend for the United States as a whole, which combines both tropical and temperate climates, we find that the case pattern depcited above for the city of St. Louis matches quite nicely.

![US_Seasonality](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvlnbMPXAAIXJOM?format=jpg&name=large)

The [Hope-Simpson seasonality model for influenze](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C4D90C6E7CB127E6DF7A52D3A9EE2974/S0950268806007175a.pdf/epidemic_influenza_and_vitamin_d.pdf) depicted above has actually been quite accurate in mapping covid-19 trends to tropical and temperate climates. Moreover, [research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-global-analysis-covid-seasonal.html) published in Evolutionary Bioinformatics shows that case counts and mortality rates are very strongly correlated with temperature and latitude, neither of which even the most pretentious of politicians claim can be manipulated. This research, combined with the trends depcited above, lends overwhelming support to the idea that the past year's worth of behavioral mandates in St. Louis were all for naught, meaning that Echols' shutdown of the Wheelhouse and Start Bar was not only completely unscientfic, but nothing short of criminal.

## NOTES

This new version of public health has brushed aside basic freedoms and completed ignored any and all data showing the utter futility of the past year's worth of behavioral mandates in favor of the feeling of safety that comes with living in a culture of unquestioned compliance to the powers that be.

spent the majority of 2020 unleashing a successful campaign of [mass hysteria](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1376/htm?fbclid=IwAR3hKqZ614zBr9zHXBOuaxTA8Z0Dt9Hb-TxObCY3qdpCJFuqh_Mmh3jCdtQ) and continue to berate the public with pithy slogans like "Wear a mask, slow the spread", and 

Private citizens, now emboldened by their establishment-backed narrative that compliance with behavioral mandates is the selfless and scientifically prudent path to defeating covid, find it their duty to publicly berate non-mask-wearers and rat out non-compiant businesses, convincing others that both as menaces to society. As a result, many individuals and private businesses, whether to avoid shutdowns, heated public confrontations, or deter fines, are forced to reluctantly fall in line with government mandates.

While ["neanderthal"](https://apple.news/AFIRA-QvPSFSM2s1Nsyox2A) states such as Texas and Mississippi (now Connecticut, a democratic state.....gonna be called a neanderthal?) are making phenomenal progress in [rolling back covid-19 mandates](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gov-greg-abbott-lift-texas-mask-mandate-open-state-100-n1259329) and returning basic freedoms to their citizens, Andrew Cuomo [recently anounced](https://nypost.com/2021/03/02/new-yorkers-must-flash-covid-19-passport-to-enter-venues-under-new-program/) a new pilot program that would require New Yorkers to show a covid-19 passport before entering certain venues.

decentralized the government's role of enforcing covid-19 mandates. 

Years from now, populations around the world will recognize their governments' responses to the covid-19 pandemic as some of the greatest public health failures in human history. Not that this shouldn't have been expected; Not only was this one of the greatest failures from a public health standpoint, but just about every little freedom we once took for granted&mdash; going to work, running businesses, visiting family and friends, .....The speed with which politicians and public health experts subdued the social behaviors of states and countries around the world is astonishing. How quickly we went from fiteen days to slow the spread
