The COVID-19 outbreak has made one thing clear: we are a nation that is quickly forgetting how to be free. How many people, in the face of economic panic, have knelt before our elected officials and financial authorities, yearning to be led out of this crisis and made secure in their livelihoods? How many people have taken comfort in the small amount of safety that comes from knowing that millions are not allowed to go to work and support their families, or leave their homes for anything other than what the state deems necessary? How many have taken comfort in knowing that the police, in complete violation of the fourth amendment, are [conducting unwarranted searches](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-door-to-door-searches-new-yorkers/) for civilians not following quarantine mandates? How many have gained a sense of peace in the idea of [forced checkpoints](https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-coronavirus-border-checkpoints-nyc-louisiana-self-quarantine-60-days-jail) and the ability of the state to [dictate what companies ought to produce](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/trump-slams-gm-over-ventilator-production-delays-costs-151885)? How many people have taken comfort in their measly, expropriated share of the $2 trillion stimulus package? And how many people have marveled at the state's power to indefinitely shut down the economy and bring millions of lives to a halt?

It appears we live in a nation of people who have chosen to dismiss, or are blissfully ignorant of, the wealth of historical evidence--expertly documented in Robert Higgs' [*Crisis and Leviathan*](https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Leviathan-Government-Anniversary-Independent/dp/1598131117)--which lays bare the state's tradition of arrogating unwarranted powers during crises and emergencies, powers that never fully recede from the state's arsenal of economic and political manipulation.

It is likely that we simply can't conceive of our public servants and their "experts" as being capable of wreaking nationwide political and economic destruction. "This is the United States," we say, "our dear leaders won't let things get *that* bad!"

The question of whether or not private citizens are permitted to keep their "non-essential" businesses open, go to work, or attend church isn't even up for debate. We can only hope that the state will continue to permit us to do certain things, and then shrug our shoulders with mumbles of "Well, that's the price we have to pay" as more of our freedoms become restricted. In the meantime, we are to do as our elected officials and their experts have told us, because our unquestioned obedience is necessary to secure our safety. 

Private citizens are too irrational and un-predictable to handle this pandemic on their own. Without local, state, or federal mandates, how could we ever understand the importance of choosing to stay at home and distancing ourselves to prevent the spread of infection? How could any group of private actors possibly devise a more efficient and effective solution for the COVID-19 pandemic than our wise experts? It simply cannot happen, especially in a nation whose private enterprises have solved countless problems to catapult living standards to the highest degree ever attained in all of human history, and have given us just about every modern technological advancement and luxury that we'd go crazy to live without. Only a fool would suggest that the private sector is capable of tackling this crisis.

# Our nation's predictable response

Sadly, as is the pattern with every national crisis, the fallout of our nation's economic and political decline will be met with cries for more government intervention in our economy, an economy whose [impending recession](https://fee.org/articles/covid-19-isn-t-the-true-culprit-of-the-coming-recession/) only stands to be accelerated by this virus.

No doubt there will also be cries for additional regulation on behalf of the institutions whose [laws have hindered](https://fee.org/articles/the-fda-is-still-undermining-coronavirus-response-efforts/) the resourcefulness and productivity of the market's response to this crisis.

Perhaps most important will be the neglect of the true culprit behind our economy's poor health, The Federal Reserve: the most unaccountable, most influential, and therefore the most dangerous financial institution in the United States. Directed by its presidentially appointed Chairman, the monetary schemes of the Federal Reserve stand *completely* removed from any trace of democratic accountability. 

Adding insult to injury, very few people care to understand the deep interconnectedeness between the Federal Reserve, the big banks, and the United States Treasury. The Federal Reserve enjoys a totally unbridled monopoly on interest rate manipulation and the money supply, a power that terrifies far too few people.

Fortunately, the Austrian School of economists has correctly focused blame for the Great Depression, the Dot Com crash at the turn of the 21st century, and the housing crisis of 2008 and 2009 on the Federal Reserve and its manipulation of interest rates and generation of abundantly cheap credit. 

It was also the Austrian economists who predicted these recessions, giving immense credibility to their [teachings on the business cycle](https://mises.org/wire/austrian-business-cycle-theory-explained), which are more valuable now than ever. Our understanding of the coming recession will be key in determining whether or not more restraints and regulations will creep their way into our every-day lives.

Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve, by continuing to [engage in the same type of monetary policy](https://mises.org/wire/coronavirus-central-banks-stand-ready-more-stimulus) that has weakened our economy leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak, has set the stage for a tremendous recession, a recession that will impoverish far more individuals than have been hurt by our economy's shut down, and to a much greater extent.

And if the pattern holds, we can expect a vast majority of people, when severe recession settles in, to turn to the Federal Reserve and other state officials for economic salvation.

# How much are we willing to give?

As Larry Reed [made clear](https://fee.org/articles/a-nation-s-true-test-comes-after-the-crisis/), our nation's true test is yet to come. When the crisis is over, we will be able to fully assess, as Reed notes, the extent of the measures taken to combat the virus; we will gain a much clearer picture of just how far the state overstepped its supposed bounds. That is why we should ever be on guard against the state's arrogation of unwarranted powers, especially in light of what history has shown the state is capable of doing in times of emergency. Once certain freedoms have been forfeited, that forfeiture will always serve as the precedent for future power grabs. 

We have already given up the freedom to work and provide for our families, the right to avoid inspection without presumption of having committed a crime, the right to go to church, and the right to travel at certain hours and to certain locations without the threat of facing arrest and/or imprisonment. We have allowed the state to determine whose livelihoods are "essential" and whose are "non-essential", and we will sooner look to the state to resolve the fallout of the economic destruction that is yet to come.
