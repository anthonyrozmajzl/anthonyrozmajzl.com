It isn't often we get to witness esteemed public health experts falter when the science behind lockdowns and mask mandates is called into question. The first memorable instance occurred a couple months ago when White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt was reduced to empty platitudes about masks and social distancing after [fumbling](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) for an explanation during an MSNBC interview as to why a completely open Florida was seeing [lower hospitalizations per million](https://cdn.mises.org/roz1.png) and [lower age-adjusted deaths per million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExvLaPnWUAU14K-?format=jpg&name=large) than a harshly locked down California. Then, the establishment's sainted health expert, Dr. Anthony Facui, recently [expressed](https://twitter.com/Izzy_B911/status/1381071918502141952?s=20) confusion during an MSNBC interview in which he remarked that he wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was still experiencing falling cases and deaths one month after having lifted their statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions&mdash; remember, the effects of easing restrictions are supposed to be clearly visible after only two weeks. 

Although it's nice to see estalbishment ideologues shakily attempt to explain away the COVID situation in Texas and Florida, the fact of the matter is that these states are hardly the only examples of regions where the removal or easing of non-pharmaceutial interventions (NPIs)&mdash;mask mandates, business closures, travel restrictions, curfews, social distancing guidelines, gathering restrictions&mdash;have failed to result in a disastrous increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Conversely, there are plenty of examples showing that the ramping up of NPIs failed to shield a particular region from massive surges in COVID-19. 



Much like invoking nat'l security, public health was invoked to 

- medical professionals directing economy, only qualified to quantify risk
-   unfortunately, the imperial college model which quantified the risk that led to lockdowns was horribly failed and off by an order of magnitude
-   CDC in charge of evictions??

- throwing out basic science: ideas like asymptomatic people can still be sick, lckdowns never recommended for even sever respiratory outbreaks prior to 2020
-   Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

MAIN
- mortality table
-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns
