It isn't often we get to witness esteemed public health experts falter when the science behind lockdowns and mask mandates is called into question. Recently the establishment's sainted health expert, Dr. Anthony Facui, [expressed](https://twitter.com/Izzy_B911/status/1381071918502141952?s=20) confusion during an MSNBC interview in which he remarked that he wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was still experiencing falling cases and deaths one month after having lifted their statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions&mdash; remember, the effects of easing restrictions are supposed to be clearly visible after only two weeks. Moreoever, Dr. Michael Osterholm made a recent appearance on a Fox News Sunday segment with Chris Wallace where he [admitted](https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1382824553768837125?s=20) that the case growth patterns we've seen over the past year were the result of the "cycle of regional activity" rather than a failure to comply with COVID-19 mitigation measures. Osterholm never directly addressed Wallace's question as to why certain states and regions that have removed restrictions or ended their lockdowns never saw the doomsday-level rise in COVID cases that were predicted by health experts and media pundits.

These two media moments should serve as reminder of the farce these past 15 months have been. Even though the science on masking and social distancing is supposedly settleTwo esteemed medical experts failing to f the past 15 months of data have definitively revealed anything, it is that the duration, timing, and intensity of the implementation or removal of non-pharmaceutial interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandates, curfews, capacity restrictions, etc. have had zero bearing on COVID-19 incidence.


## Public Health Principles Thrown Out the Window
Much like invoking nat'l security, public health was invoked to 

- medical professionals directing economy, only qualified to quantify risk
-   unfortunately, the imperial college model which quantified the risk that led to lockdowns was horribly failed and off by an order of magnitude
-   CDC in charge of evictions??

- throwing out basic science: ideas like asymptomatic people can still be sick, lckdowns never recommended for even sever respiratory outbreaks prior to 2020
-   Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

MAIN
- mortality table
-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns
