In the past couple of months, our esteemed public health experts have had a rough time defending the supposedly settled science behind lockdowns and mask mandates.
White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt was first on the chopping block back in mid-February when he was [reduced to parroting empty platitudes](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) about mask mandates and social distancing after being unable to explain why a complete open Florida had lower hospitalization numbers and age-adjusted deaths per million than strictly locked down California. Then comes media darling Dr. Fauci, who has had a particularly bad series of public appearances as of late. During a [recent MSNBC interview](https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1381073146590208000?s=20) Fauci expressed confusion and wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was experiencing falling cases and deaths an entire month after lifting its mask mandates and capacity restrictions. And if that wasn't enough, Fauci [recently dodged](https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1382818277399748611?s=20) Rep. Jim Jordan's direct question as to why Texas has lower case rates than some of the most notable lockdown states, to which Fauci responded that having a lockdown is not the same thing as obeying lockdowns. This is true, but is Dr. Fauci prepared to claim that citizens of New York and New Jersy, two notorious lockdown states, are complying less with mitigation mesaures than a state that has practically none? A quick check of Google's [COVID-19 Mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) lays this ridiculous assumption to rest. Lastly, in a recent Fox News [appearance](https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1382489849714802689?s=20), Dr. Micahel Osterholm of the University of Minnesota summarized the past year's worth of regional case trends as "a cycle of regional activity." If that's not a clear admission of the fuitlity of lockdowns and mask mandates, I am not sure what is.

GOAL POST SHIFT OF THE CENTURY


## Public Health Principles Thrown Out the Window
Much like invoking nat'l security, public health was invoked to 

- medical professionals directing economy, only qualified to quantify risk
-   unfortunately, the imperial college model which quantified the risk that led to lockdowns was horribly failed and off by an order of magnitude
-   CDC in charge of evictions??

- throwing out basic science: ideas like asymptomatic people can still be sick, lckdowns never recommended for even sever respiratory outbreaks prior to 2020
-   Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

KEY DATA POINTS AND STUDIES TO REMEMBER
- mortality table
-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns

- Key Points To Remember:
  - Mortality Table
  - Costs

- Superspreader Failed Predictions
- Neanderthal States vs Non-Neanderthals
