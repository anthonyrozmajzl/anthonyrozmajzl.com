In the past couple of months, our esteemed public health experts have had a rough go of defending the supposedly settled science behind lockdowns and mask mandates.
White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt was first on the chopping block back in mid-February when he was [reduced to parroting empty platitudes](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) about mask mandates and social distancing after being unable to explain why a completely open Florida had numbers no worse than a strictly locked down California. Slavitt, to his credit, was at least able to admit that there was much about the virus we think we know and can preict. Then comes media darling Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has had a particularly embarassing series of public appearances as of late. During a [recent MSNBC interview](https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1381073146590208000?s=20) Fauci expressed confusion and wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was experiencing falling cases and deaths an entire month after lifting its mask mandates and capacity restrictions. And if that wasn't enough, Fauci [completely dodged](https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1382818277399748611?s=20) Rep. Jim Jordan's direct question as to why Texas has lower case rates than some of the most notable lockdown states, to which Fauci simply responded that having a lockdown is not the same thing as obeying lockdowns. Fauci is correct here, but is he prepared to claim that citizens of New York and New Jersy, two notorious lockdown states, are complying less with mitigation mesaures than a state that has practically none? A quick check of Google's [COVID-19 Mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) lays this counterintuitive assumption to rest. Lastly, in a recent Fox News [appearance](https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1382489849714802689?s=20), Dr. Micahel Osterholm of the University of Minnesota summarized the past year's worth of regional case trends as "a cycle of regional activity" with no mention of individuals' failure to comply with mitigation measures. If that's not a tacit admission of the fuitlity of lockdowns and mask mandates, I am not sure what is.

## Feelings Don't Care About Your Facts

When governments and media outlets around the world have successfully captured audiences by continually stoking fear about COVID-19, the data that should so easily asuage this fear become irrelevant, and interviews like those mentioned above are simply brushed aside in favor of the fearborne allegiance to government-mandated lockdowns, curfews, mask mandates, capacity restrictions, travel restrictions, and more. This "scared straight" approach, as Bill Maher [described it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp3gy_CLXho), is the government's bludgeon of compliance. A recent study showed that [roughly 90 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/world/covid-coverage-by-the-us-national-media-is-an-outlier-a-study-finds.html) of United States COVID coverage was negative, compared to only 51 percent in the international media. Moreover, Project Veritas released footage showing how CNN [played up the COVID-19 death toll] to drive up network numbers. "If it bleeds it leads," CNN Techincal Director Charlie Chester said to an undercover Project Veritas reporter. With nearly all negative COVID-19 headlines that tend to ignore promising trends from states that removed restrictions and avoid bad trends from regions that are "following the science", along fear-leeching news outlets like CNN, is it then any surprise, as Maher pointed out, that nearly 70 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of Republicans, and almost 50 percent of independents think the chance

## Public Health Principles Thrown Out the Window
Much like invoking nat'l security, public health was invoked to 

- medical professionals directing economy, only qualified to quantify risk
-   unfortunately, the imperial college model which quantified the risk that led to lockdowns was horribly failed and off by an order of magnitude
-   CDC in charge of evictions??

- throwing out basic science: ideas like asymptomatic people can still be sick, lckdowns never recommended for even sever respiratory outbreaks prior to 2020
-   Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

KEY DATA POINTS AND STUDIES TO REMEMBER
- mortality table
-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns

- Key Points To Remember:
  - Mortality Table
  - Costs

- Superspreader Failed Predictions
- Neanderthal States vs Non-Neanderthals
