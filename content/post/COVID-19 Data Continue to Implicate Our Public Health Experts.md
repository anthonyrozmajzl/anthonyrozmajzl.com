In the past couple of months, our esteemed public health experts have had a rough go of defending the supposedly settled science behind lockdowns and mask mandates.
White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt was first on the chopping block back in mid-February when he was [reduced to parroting empty platitudes](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) about mask mandates and social distancing after being unable to explain why a completely open Florida had numbers no worse than a strictly locked down California. Slavitt, to his credit, was at least able to admit that there was much about the virus we think we know and can preict. Then comes media darling Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has had a particularly embarassing series of public appearances as of late. During a [recent MSNBC interview](https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1381073146590208000?s=20) Fauci expressed confusion and wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was experiencing falling cases and deaths an entire month after lifting its mask mandates and capacity restrictions. And if that wasn't enough, Fauci [completely dodged](https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1382818277399748611?s=20) Rep. Jim Jordan's direct question as to why Texas has lower case rates than some of the most notable lockdown states, to which Fauci simply responded that having a lockdown is not the same thing as obeying lockdowns. Fauci is correct here, but is he prepared to claim that citizens of New York and New Jersy, two notorious lockdown states, are complying less with mitigation mesaures than a state that has practically none? A quick check of Google's [COVID-19 Mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) lays this counterintuitive assumption to rest. Lastly, in a recent Fox News [appearance](https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1382489849714802689?s=20), Dr. Micahel Osterholm of the University of Minnesota summarized the past year's worth of regional case trends as "a cycle of regional activity" with no mention of individuals' failure to comply with mitigation measures. If that's not a tacit admission of the fuitlity of lockdowns and mask mandates, I am not sure what is.

## Feelings Don't Care About Your Facts

When governments and media outlets around the world have successfully captured audiences by stoking fear of COVID-19, the data that should so easily asuage this fear become irrelevant, and interviews like those mentioned above are simply brushed aside in favor of a fearborne allegiance to the "morally superior" government-mandated lockdowns, curfews, mask mandates, capacity restrictions, travel restrictions, and more. This "scared straight" approach, as Bill Maher correctly [described it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp3gy_CLXho), is the state's bludgeon of compliance. As far scaring citizens straight, Project Veritas has released footage showing CNN employees [explaining](https://nypost.com/2021/04/14/cnn-staffer-tells-project-veritas-network-played-up-covid-19-death-toll-for-ratings/) how the network plays up the COVID-19 death toll to drive numbers. Especially disgraceful from this footage was CNN Techincal Director Charlie Chester's admission that CNN doesn't like to report recovery rates because "That's not scary. . . If it bleeds it leads." As we all know, there is nothing scary about COVID-19's mortality rate.

CNN isn't alone in this endeavor, but thanks to the surplus of fear-mongering news outlets and nearly all negative COVID-19 reporting&mdash;roughly [90 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/world/covid-coverage-by-the-us-national-media-is-an-outlier-a-study-finds.html) of COVID-19 news in the United States is negative compared to 51 percent internationally&mdash;is it any surprise that nearly [70 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of Republicans, and almost 50 percent of independents](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/briefing/atlanta-shootings-kamala-harris-tax-deadline-2021.html) think the chances of being hospitalized with COVID-19 range anywhere from 20 percent to over 50 percent? We are not only in a pandemic of ingornace towards the risk COVID-19 poses to the vast majority of the population, but also toward the past year's worth of data showing no correlation between the timing, stregth, or duration of COVID-19 mitigation measures and overal COVID-19 incidence.

## Still No Evidence for Lockdowns or Mask Mandates

Leaving aside the disatrous and deadly consequences of lockdowns&mdash;see [here](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/), [here](https://collateralglobal.org/research), and [here](http://thepriceofpanic.com)&mdash;which alone made them a disgraceful failure, the amount of evidence supporting the lockdowns' ability to mitigate COVID-19 mortality has always remained abysmal. 

Looking at the United States, we can address the widely believed notion that states with more intense lockdowns will see fewer COVID-19 deaths by plotting each state's average ranking from the past 13 months against the total number of COVID-19 deaths for each state. Now, if the past year's worth of sanctimonious lectures from public health experts had any scientific weight behind them, we should see a strong negative correlation between the intensity of states' restrictions and total COVID-19 deaths.

![Restriction Ranking vs Deaths](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/115307212-e196e280-a136-11eb-8ca9-7c4751380613.png)

Contrary to what we've been taught to believe about lockdowns, there is absolutely no correlation between the strength of a state's lockdown measures and total COVID-19 deaths. In fact, notorious lockdown states such as New York and New Jersey have some of the worst mortality numbers to date. To blame non-compliance for these poor numbers is ridiculous on its face considering states with no restrictions, such as Texas and Flordia, have far fewer deaths than New York and New Jersey. In fact, you'll find that every state that has either [removed its mask mandate or all COVID-19 restrictions entirely](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyfzUnXUcAIvi8a?format=jpg&name=large) is outperforming New York and New Jersey.

The same lack of correlation can be seen when comparing average lockdown stringency with the total number of patients hospitalized who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. As a point of clarification, the author summed the *current* number of patients hospitalized each day to arrive at the total number of patients hospitalized. This will result in slightly inflated total numbers since patients may spend more than one day in the hospital, but the same summation method is applied to all states, so the total hospitalization metric still provides an accurate assessment of total COVID-19 hospitalization incidence.

If you remember, the lockdowns were first instituted based on predictions from the [horribly failed](https://www.aier.org/article/the-disease-models-were-tested-and-failed-massively/) Imperial College London model. But the data have made it overwhelmingly clear that, at least speaking for the United States, the strength and duration of each state's lockdown played absolutely no role in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations or reducing the overall COVID-19 death toll. 

Internationally speaking, the data continue to expose lockdowns as the single greatest public health failure in human history. As you can see, yet again, there is no correlation on an international level between lockdown stringency and overall death toll. 

![Stringency vs Deaths per Million](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5093552/115928867-d3a5d200-a454-11eb-949a-39e8dd4cbda6.png)

As a supplement to the above chart, you can also check out AIER's [collection of 35 studies](https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/) which show no relationship between lockdowns and virus mitigation. 

In light of a year's worth of data showing wildly different mortality and hospitalizations outcomes for fifty states with fifty very different lockdown stringencies, as well as drastically different mortality outcomes for 166 countries with 166 different lockdown stringencies, it's a marvel that such a deadly and ineffective policy can be seriously considered among public health experts. So much for the virtue signalling from the self-proclaimed martyrs who boasted of remaining in social isolation for the better part of 14 months.

If the lockdowns failed as a mitigation measure in the United States just as they did everywhere else in the world&mdash;remember, the lockdowns fail without even taking their costs into account&mdash;it's possible that mask usage is the missing piece in the mitigation puzzle. Now, it wouldn't be fair to the reader to post quite literally hundreds of charts that show the exact opposite outcomes the media would have you expect after regions remove or institute mask mandates&mdash;[Ian Miller](https://twitter.com/ianmSC/media) has done more work in this area than anybody else. It also wouldn't be fair to claim that mask mandates and mask usage are synonymous. However, I don't think any proponent of mask-wearing would seriously expect the same level of mask usage apart from local and statewide mandates. Nevertheless, the claim that mask *usage* negatively correlates with cases and deaths is simply not true.
