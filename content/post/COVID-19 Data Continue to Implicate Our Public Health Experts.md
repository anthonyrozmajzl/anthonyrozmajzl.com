In the past couple of months, our esteemed public health experts have had a rough go of defending the supposedly settled science behind lockdowns and mask mandates.
White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt was first on the chopping block back in mid-February when he was [reduced to parroting empty platitudes](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) about mask mandates and social distancing after being unable to explain why a completely open Florida had numbers no worse than a strictly locked down California. Slavitt, to his credit, was at least able to admit that there was much about the virus we think we know and can preict. Then comes media darling Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has had a particularly embarassing series of public appearances as of late. During a [recent MSNBC interview](https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1381073146590208000?s=20) Fauci expressed confusion and wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was experiencing falling cases and deaths an entire month after lifting its mask mandates and capacity restrictions. And if that wasn't enough, Fauci [completely dodged](https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1382818277399748611?s=20) Rep. Jim Jordan's direct question as to why Texas has lower case rates than some of the most notable lockdown states, to which Fauci simply responded that having a lockdown is not the same thing as obeying lockdowns. Fauci is correct here, but is he prepared to claim that citizens of New York and New Jersy, two notorious lockdown states, are complying less with mitigation mesaures than a state that has practically none? A quick check of Google's [COVID-19 Mobility reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) lays this counterintuitive assumption to rest. Lastly, in a recent Fox News [appearance](https://twitter.com/covid_clarity/status/1382489849714802689?s=20), Dr. Micahel Osterholm of the University of Minnesota summarized the past year's worth of regional case trends as "a cycle of regional activity" with no mention of individuals' failure to comply with mitigation measures. If that's not a tacit admission of the fuitlity of lockdowns and mask mandates, I am not sure what is.

## Feelings Don't Care About Your Facts

When governments and media outlets around the world have successfully captured audiences by stoking fear of COVID-19, the data that should so easily asuage this fear become irrelevant, and interviews like those mentioned above are simply brushed aside in favor of the fearborne allegiance to government-mandated lockdowns, curfews, mask mandates, capacity restrictions, travel restrictions, and more. This "scared straight" approach, as Bill Maher [described it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp3gy_CLXho), is the government's bludgeon of compliance. For example, Project Veritas recently released footage showing CNN employees describing how the network [plays up the COVID-19 death toll](https://nypost.com/2021/04/14/cnn-staffer-tells-project-veritas-network-played-up-covid-19-death-toll-for-ratings/) to drive numbers. Especially disgraceful was CNN Techincal Director Charlie Chester's admission that CNN doesn't like to report recovery rates&mdash;COVID-19 has a survival rate of [99 percent](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) for those under sixty&mdash;because "That's not scary. . . If it bleeds it leads." Chester also spoke of a "red phone" that newtork director Jeff Zucker uses to control, nearly realtime, the COVID-19 graphics appearing on screen in a way that drives more fear to increase ratings. 

Thanks to the surplus of fear-mongering news outlets and nearly all negative COVID-19 reporting&mdash;roughly [90 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/world/covid-coverage-by-the-us-national-media-is-an-outlier-a-study-finds.html) of COVID-19 news in the United States is negative compared to 51 percent internationally&mdash;which ignores promising trends from states that removed restrictions while ignoring undesirable trends from regions that are "following the science", is it any surprise that nearly [70 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of Republicans, and almost 50 percent of independents](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/briefing/atlanta-shootings-kamala-harris-tax-deadline-2021.html) think the chances of being hospitalized with COVID-19 range anywhere from 20 percent to over 50 percent? Ignorance, whether it be willful or not, of the past 15 months worth of data which show no correlation between the timing, strength, or duration of COVID-19 mitigations measures and COVID-19 incidence is the far more emergent pandemic.

## The Lockdowns Still Haven't Worked

Leaving aside the disatrous and deadly consequences of lockdowns&mdash;see [here](https://rationalground.com/lockdowns-pros-and-cons/), [here](https://collateralglobal.org/research), and [here](http://thepriceofpanic.com)&mdash;which alone made them an utter failure, the amount of evidence supporting the lockdowns' ability to stop, let alone slow the incidence of COVID-19 is abysmal. For more than a year we've seen states like New York, New Jersey, and California praised for their COVID-19 response while . Thankfully, the data exist to evaluate this claim directly. 


KEY DATA POINTS AND STUDIES TO REMEMBER
- mortality table
-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns
