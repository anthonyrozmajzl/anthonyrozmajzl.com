It's not very often we get to witness the supposedly settled science behind lockdowns and mask mandates challenged on national television, which make the past couple months of media appearances from public health experts like White House COVID-19 advisor Andy Slavitt, Dr. Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, and media darling Dr. Anthony Fauci truly special to have on record. Slavitt was first on the chopping block back in mid-February when he was [reduced to parroting empty platitudes](https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1362048016560062466?s=20) about mask mandates and social distancing after being unable to explain why a complete open Florida had lower hospitalization numbers and age-adjusted deaths per million than strictly locked down California. Then comes Dr. Fauci, who has had a particularly bad series of public appearances as of late. During a [recent MSNBC interview](https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1381073146590208000?s=20) Fauci expressed confusion and wasn't "quite sure" as to why Texas was experiencing falling cases and deaths an entire month after lifting its mask mandates and capacity restrictions. If that wasn't enough, Fauci [recently dodged](https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1382818277399748611?s=20) Rep. Jim Jordan's direct question as to why Texas was outperforming some of the most notable lockdown states in daily cases, to which Fauci responded that having a lockdown is not the same thing as obeying lockdowns. Is Dr. Fauci prepared to claim that citizens of New York and New Jersy are complying less with lockdown orders than a state that doesn't have any?

GOAL POST SHIFT OF THE CENTURY


## Public Health Principles Thrown Out the Window
Much like invoking nat'l security, public health was invoked to 

- medical professionals directing economy, only qualified to quantify risk
-   unfortunately, the imperial college model which quantified the risk that led to lockdowns was horribly failed and off by an order of magnitude
-   CDC in charge of evictions??

- throwing out basic science: ideas like asymptomatic people can still be sick, lckdowns never recommended for even sever respiratory outbreaks prior to 2020
-   Past statememnts as evidence for Facui flip-flopping....mention how the only time he receives any real opposition is during the occasional senate hearing with Rand Paul.....variant spread

KEY DATA POINTS AND STUDIES TO REMEMBER
- mortality table
-asymptomatic spread
  - the study Fauci cited (https://twitter.com/hold2llc/status/1381448535665745920?s=21) claiming 50% of spread is from asymptomatic assumes that asymptomatic cases are 75% as infectious as symptomatic cases
-lockdown efficacy
-mask mandate efficacy
-hospitals overwhelmed

You can point to superspreader after superspreader and see that despite the doom and gloom predictions, none of these so-called superspreaders had any effect on case patterns

  - Costs
