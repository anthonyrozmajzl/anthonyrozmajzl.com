In a matter of hours the entire nation was made aware of the gruesome and undeniably wrongful death of George Floyd, a 46 year old man who was [suffocated](https://twitter.com/QasimRashid/status/1265389213714915333) to death for [using a forged $20 bill](https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/man-pinned-down-by-minneapolis-police-officer-dies.html) at Cup Foods, a small grocery store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

This tragedy has unequivocally refocused national attention on the problem of police brutality, a well-known feature of the current police system.[^1] Social media is laced with dozens, if not hundreds of videos capturing horrific abuses of power in the wake of protests catalyzed by Floyd's death. I am not talking so much about the aggressive and unconvenctional law enforcment measures taken against belligerent rioters and aggressive thieves, but those taken against peaceful protestors and non-violent citizens for crimes like [voicing discontent](https://twitter.com/sweeeetdee_/status/1267319103167107072?s=20) with local law enforcement or [filming police from your private property](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/02/george-floyd-protest-minneapolis-cops-shoot-paint-people-porch/3123781001/). These are but a couple of the many instances of badge abuse that have occurred in the past couple of weeks. Far more disturbing, however, is The Free Thought Project's collection of [more than 600 pages](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/category/cop-watch/) of incidents in which police officers are caught grossly abusing their power. 

This is hardly to say there are no good or honest police officers. But thanks to the [abundance of laws](https://mises.org/wire/too-many-laws-why-police-encounters-escalate) that mark many non-violent persons as criminals, good police officers, and many bad ones, are unnecessarily thrust into dangerous situations where excessive force and abuses of power are likely to manifest. This host of criminal offenses, mingled with an overwhelming rap sheet[^2] of badge abuse nd an utter lack of decent economic incentives, make it such that the chances of a deadly encounter with a police officer are far more likely than a deadly encounter with a private security guard.

In light of nationwide protesting that has been directed towards [state institutions](https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2020/05/protesters-gather-in-columbus-over-death-of-george-floyd.html), [national sites of worship](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/1/lincoln-memorial-wwii-memorial-defaced-vandals-rio/) and [police departments](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/protests-looting-erupt-again-minneapolis-area-following-death-george-floyd-n1216881), it is time that our nation look to the marketplace--filled with some of the most brilliant and innovative entrepreneurship--to resolve the problems stemming from the state's coercively funded monopoly on police provision.

## Problem #1: The police have no duty to protect you

The first serious issue with government police is that they are [under no legal obligation to protect you](https://mises.org/power-market/police-have-no-duty-protect-you-federal-court-affirms-yet-again), according to Supreme Court cases *DeShaney vs. Winnebago* and *Town of Castle Rock vs. Gonzales*. 

Much of the looting and rioting in Minneapolis has gone unchecked simply because the police are not around to subdue it, leaving citizens to fend for themselves as their businesses are all but burned to the ground. And in only a matter of days, a frighteningly [extensive](https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/a-list-of-the-buildings-damaged-looted-in-minneapolis-riots) number of buildings have been freely pillaged by Minneapolis rioters.

How can it be that the men and women whose job it is to protect our communities, defend our property, and stop criminal activity can simply walk away and cease to provide the services for which we are all forced to pay, especially when these services are most needed? Who else can Minneapolis store owners call when their state-sponsored law enforcement fails to show up? 

In no area of the market economy would consumers excuse such a blatant denial of products or services for which they had paid. Imagine being refused the keys to a vehicle you just purchased solely because the car dealership claimed they had no obligation to hand you the keys to the car you've just purchased. Would you not sue this dealership, publicize their horrible business practices, and immediately take your patronage elsewhere?

## Problem #2: No competition allowed

This brings us to the second major problem with the state-funded police: the prohibition of competing police forces. 

Competition gives rise to the abundance of different products and services available to us. It encourages innovation, cost-cutting, day-to-day efficiency, and friendly customer service. Business that do a better job of implementing these things are going to satisfy a greater number of consumers and be rewarded with larger revenue and increased profits. The moment consumers become dissatisfied with a business for any reason, they file complaints, leave negative reviews, request refunds and returns, or take their money elsewhere. As a business owner or entrepreneur, refusing to correct any inefficiencies, ignoring customer feedback, or ceasing to innovate is an open invitation for another business and entrepreneurs to take your place. Because markets operate in this manner, they present us with a tremendous overflow of choices that allow us to seamlessly switch between products and services to appease our ever-changing preferences. 

But rather than subjecting state-funded police to the same mechanisms that make market economies so competitive and flowing with choice--freedom of entry, the profit and loss mechanism, competitive innovation, and the desire to reduce business costs--there is no question that a majority of our nation would rather it be the sacrosanct duty of the state alone to provide us with policing services. And why should that be? Policing services are no more unique than any other service, nor is their provision too complicated for the world's most technologically advanced and innovative private sector[^3]

Aren't businesses, apartment complexes, neighborhoods, and other service providers--key stakeholders in a community's well-being--strongly incentivised to provide policing services so that customers can safely patronize their businesses and individuals can feel safe in their apartments and neighborhoods?

Is there any objection to the obvious fact that the incentive for community stakeholders to offer policing services would be met with an equal demand for security on behalf of individual consumers and property owners, none of whom desire to live in unsafe neighborhoods or shop in dangerous communities? Whatever private police forces may *look* like, the only relevant question is whether or not there is a demand for these services. As long as the demand exists, and it always will, market entrepreneurship will take care of the rest.

Murray Rothbard offered a sound defense of privatized police

## Problem #3: Political Moral Hazard

Moral hazard is introduced when individuals are incentivised to engage in questionable behavior without fear of suffering its potential consequences. 

The doctrine of [qualified immunity](https://www.cato.org/blog/why-qualified-immunity) is quite possibly the biggest contributer to moral hazard in the policing community. Simply put, qualified immunity allows police officers--and other state officials--to avoid accountability for undeniably illegal and grossly immoral practices so long as their very specific circumstances and practices haven't been strictly ruled on in a prior court proceeding. Clark Neily [describes](https://www.cato.org/blog/officer-involved-killing-george-floyd) how this doctrine could be used to have George Floyd's case quickly tossed out of court:

>if Mr. Floyd’s family wants to sue the officer who took his life, they will need to find an existing case from the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals holding that a police officer may not kneel on a unresisting suspect’s neck, ignoring his pleas for help, until he passes out. If no such case happens to be on the books, their case will be summarily tossed out of court. Such is the perversity of the Supreme Court’s qualified immunity doctrine.

Without a specific prior ruling on the exact circumstances and brutal methods of law enforcement, the doctrine of qualified immunity can be used to excuse a seemingly endless number of grossly immoral and over-aggressive policing behaviors. What private policing service could expect to gain any customers when right up their sleeve is the ability to dismiss any claims brought against their employees for abuses of power?

## Problem #4: Economic Moral Hazard

In addition to qualified immunity, all government-run businesses and government-granted monopolies, including police departments, face the moral hazard of being severed from the profit and loss mechanisms of the market.

The very simple metrics of profit and loss determine how successful business are in meeting the needs of consumers. Private enterprises that waste resources, drive away customers with poor service, or refuse to tailor their products and services to meet consumer demand will quickly find themselves losing revenue as consumers decide to patronize the more profitable, i.e. successful, businesses.

Police departments, being financially secured through taxation and, as a last resort the printing press, face no financial consequences for squandering resources, failing to cut costs, refusing to innovate, or wrongfully killing one of their constituents. This is because the continued operation of police departments is not contingent upon the voluntary patronage of its citizens. No amount of consumer dissatisfaction, resource waste, or business malpractice will lead to a loss of revenue that would force departments to rethink their allocation of resources or business practices.

## There was no reason for George Floyd to die

One can only wonder whether George Floyd would have died if his arrest had been carried out by a privatized police force that was (1) held accountable to the profit and loss system, (2) was in constant competition with other agencies for providing the most just and peaceful means of dispute resolution, (3) wasn't anointed with the doctrine of qualified immunity, and (4) did not have to lay a hefty fine and/or imprison non-violent persons for using a forged $20 bill.

We live in the world's most technologically advanced and competitive economy. Normal human beings will always demand protection for themselves, their families, and their property. Amidst all the protests and dissatisfaction with state police forces, now is the perfect time for the free market to assume the duty of policing our communities.

[^1]: This claim is hardly irrefutable, as the term "police brutality" is the only one of its kind. Ask yourself the last time you heard someone speak of "Walmart brutality," "Costco brutality," "Pizza shop brutality," and so on. This term is uniquely attributable to state-funded police.

[^2]: I would challenge any proponent of state-funded police to find a single surviving private company whose number of instances of physical abuse and intimidation of their customers rival that of state-funded police. 

[^3]: Most people simply lack the imagination to even entertain the notion of privatized police. They will use their inability to conceive of what a private policing business might look like in practice as evidence for the impracticality of private policing.
