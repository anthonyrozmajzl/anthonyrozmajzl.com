As consumers, we don't like when prices go up; it means we'll have less money to spend on other things. When prices increase, we typically look with scorn on the company raising the prices, especially if the price change seems arbitrary. It's easy to be understanding when grocery stores, for example, need to increase their prices if the cost of stocking their shelves rises. However, we'd be a little less understanding if we found them raising prices for no good reason. 

Strangely, the typical negativity towards price increases doesn't seem to hold when the government is the one raising the prices, specifically when it inflates labor prices through minimum wage laws.

# Supply and demand in the labor market
Basic economics tells us that when the price of any good is arbitrarily raised above its market value, buyers will demand less of the good while sellers will want to supply more of it. Labor, just like any other economic good, falls under these same rules. When the government raises the price of labor above the market rate, fewer employers (buyers of labor) will be willing to hire, while more workers (sellers of labor) will be willing to work. As a result, a surplus of labor (i.e., unemployment) ensues.

Workers see the minimum wage as a good thing because their paychecks will increase. Employers, on the other hand, view the wage increases as a bad thing because they raise operating costs. This tug of war between employer and worker creates an imbalance in the marketplace where employers become less willing to hire, but individuals become more willing to work. The only way to correct this imbalance is for the government to allow the price of labor to return to its market level by removing minimum wage controls. 

# Additional operating costs force employers to economize
When faced with a minimum wage imposition, employers are forced to economize to offset the effects of increased labor expenses. One of the most obvious ways for employers to economize is by laying off their employees. This decision, forced upon the employer by the government, rules whether an employee gets to continue working at some politically detested market rate, or work zero hours at a rate determined by his benevolent representatives in office. 

It may be the case that instead of laying off X number of employees, the employer decides to reduce employee benefits. Jobs will be saved, but employees will inevitably incur additional out-of-pocket expenses for having to replace their company-subsidized benefits, in part or in whole, with fully-priced benefits from other businessses. This is, of course, assuming that employees will want to retain their current level of benefits. Something else to consider is that there was incredible value in the company having spent the time researching and consolidating the array of benefit options into a convenient package from which employees could choose. This burden now rests with the employee.

Although many large companies can afford to pay their employees a higher minimum wage--which is no justification for imposing one--small businesses are particularly burdened by this kind of legislation. A budding enterprise with little revenue and small profit is going to have a much harder time succeeding in the face of a minimum wage imposition than a company like Apple whose profits can readily absorb the increased operating costs. Consequently, smaller communities that thrive on small business will be hit hard by minimum wage laws. Think of how many businesses, *especially* small businesses, could benefit from hiring workers at a rate of $5 per hour. Employers would benefit from the low operating costs and the employees would benefit from gaining job experience and building up savings. So long as labor prices are prohibited from fluctuating freely, poor and unskilled individuals--the kinds of people who would benefit most from wages as low as $5, $4, or $3 per hour--have little hope for improving their current condition.  

Businesses don't always transfer increased operating costs onto their employees, but often times onto the everyday consumer. If a company won't lay off workers, reduce employee benefits, or make up the increased operating costs through some form of asset reallocation, they can always increase consumer prices. In this scenario, the consumer is primarily hurt since he must now spend more money to achieve an equivalent level of satisfaction. A secondary consequence of increased prices is that the consumer now has less money to spend on other goods, thereby depriving other businesses of revenue.
# The minimum wage is already hanging on by a thread
No matter how you slice it, simple economics tells us that minimum wage laws are inherently destructive to all market participants and therefore ought to be repealed. Advocating for the abolition of the minimum wage does not mean you desire for people to make less money. As you'll see, the minimum wage affects such a small number of our population that it's repeal would have practiaclly no negative side effects.

[Data](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that as of 2017, 97.7 percent of hourly paid workers are already making more than the federal minimum wage. Of the remaining 2.3 percent who make at or below the federal minimum wage level, roughly 66 percent are in the food service and preparation industry. Assuming that tips elevate this demographic above the minimum rate, it's actually the case that 99.2 percent of hourly paid workers are already making more than the minimum wage! Not only this, but the data on hourly wage rates does not take into account commission earnings, which would only increase the percentage of hourly wage workers who surpass the minimum wage. If that isn't enough, consider that among 16 to 19 year olds--a relatively uneducated and unskilled demographic--8 in every 10 are making more than the minimum wage.

# We can do without a minimum wage
These facts make clear that abolishing the minimum wage would have practically no negative consequences for hourly paid workers because nearly all of them make more than the minimum wage. Should minimum wage controls be abolsihed, large numbers of young and unskilled individuals would be able to find many more work opportunities, start saving money, and develop a set of transferrable skills. All firms, espeically the small ones, would be free to operate at reduced costs and reinvest their savings into the company or other lines of production, increase employee benefits, reduce the prices of consumer goods, and the list goes on. Who could possibly complain in this situation?

Ironically enough, the minimum wage can do nothing but decrease the chances that the unemployed will ever find jobs. Likewise it can do nothing to increase people's incomes without a corresponding decrease in someone else's income. Nevertheless, politicians support this destructive legislation on faulty economic grounds and supposed compassion for the unemployed and impoverished. Honest economists, on the other hand, can and will aptly reveal the unintended consequences of minimum wage legislation.
